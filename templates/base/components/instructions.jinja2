{# Common instructions for all analysis strategies #}

## General Analysis Guidelines

1. **Validation-First Approach**: Always validate your findings through actual calculations
   - Don't assume patterns without verification
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Cross-reference related data

2. **Progressive Exploration**: Start with overview, then drill down
   - Get sheet structure first
   - Identify key areas of interest
   - Focus analysis based on findings

3. **Code Quality**: Write clear, documented code
   - Use descriptive variable names
   - Add comments explaining logic
   - Handle errors gracefully

4. **State Management**: Leverage notebook persistence
   - Build on previous calculations
   - Reuse loaded data
   - Maintain clear variable naming

5. **Performance Awareness**: Consider file size and complexity
   - Use efficient pandas operations
   - Avoid loading entire file if not needed
   - Sample large datasets appropriately
