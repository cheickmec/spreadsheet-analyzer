## Known Issues & Blockers 🚨

### Current Issues

- Complexity score calculation test is failing
- CLI tests are missing despite functionality being complete

### Technical Debt

- FormulaNode and FormulaAnalysis types are duplicated in stage_3_formulas.py
- Should be consolidated into types.py for consistency
- Some test files are importing non-existent modules (test_base_stage.py, test_strict_typing.py)

## Metrics & Quality 📊

### Code Quality

- **Linting**: ✅ Ruff configured and passing
- **Type Coverage**: ✅ Comprehensive type hints with frozen dataclasses
- **Test Coverage**: 🟨 ~87% (per implementation status doc) - CLI tests missing
- **Documentation**: ✅ Comprehensive design docs, implementation guides, and quick reference

### Performance Benchmarks (Achieved)

Per the implementation status document:

- **Basic Analysis (10 sheets)**: 3.2 sec (Target: < 5 sec) ✅
- **Formula Analysis (10K cells)**: 18 sec (Target: < 30 sec) ✅
- **Memory Usage (50MB file)**: 1.4GB (Target: < 2GB) ✅
- **File Upload**: < 2 seconds for files up to 10MB

## Dependencies & Risks 🎯

### Key Dependencies

1. **openpyxl**: Core Excel parsing library

   - Risk: Memory usage for large files
   - Mitigation: Use read_only mode and streaming

1. **LangGraph**: Agent orchestration (planned)

   - Risk: API changes in early versions
   - Mitigation: Abstract behind interface

### Technical Risks

1. **Large File Handling**: Memory constraints with huge Excel files
1. **Formula Complexity**: Circular references and complex dependencies
1. **Performance**: Meeting sub-30s target for complex analysis

## Team Notes 📝

### Recent Decisions

- Adopted functional programming patterns with frozen dataclasses
- Implemented anchor comments system for better code documentation
- Established 90% test coverage requirement (currently at ~87%)
- Chose monolithic architecture with multi-agent intelligence
- Used Click for CLI framework over argparse/Typer
- Selected structlog for structured logging capabilities
- Implemented service layer pattern to separate business logic from CLI
- Consolidated type definitions into central types.py file

### Recent Accomplishments (July 2025)

- Fixed critical bug: Range dependencies in formulas were being ignored (e.g., SUM(B1:B100))
- Fixed formula parser to handle column ranges (A:D) and sheet names with spaces
- Implemented complete 5-stage deterministic analysis pipeline
- Added Rich terminal UI with progress bars and colored output
- Created comprehensive quick reference documentation

### Open Questions

1. Should we support Excel 95 format (.xls) or focus only on modern formats?
1. How to handle password-protected Excel files?
1. What level of macro analysis is needed for security scanning?
1. Which LLM provider to use for Phase 2 agent implementation?

## Next Actions 🎬

1. **Add comprehensive CLI tests** using Click's testing utilities
1. **Fix complexity score calculation test** that's currently failing
1. **Consolidate duplicate type definitions** (FormulaNode, FormulaAnalysis) into types.py
1. **Begin Phase 2: Agent Framework** - Start with Jupyter kernel integration
