## Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

### Overview

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps. It facilitates problem-solving by guiding the model through a step-by-step reasoning process using a coherent series of logical steps.

### Key Variations

#### 1. Few-Shot CoT

- Combines CoT with few-shot prompting for complex tasks requiring reasoning
- Provides examples with step-by-step reasoning before asking the model to solve new problems
- Particularly effective for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks

#### 2. Zero-Shot CoT

- Simply add "Let's think step by step" to the original prompt
- Achieves significant improvements without examples:
  - MultiArith: 17.7% → 78.7% accuracy
  - GSM8K: 10.4% → 40.7% accuracy
- Most effective for arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks

#### 3. Auto-CoT

- Eliminates manual effort by automatically generating reasoning chains
- Two main steps:
  1. Question clustering: Groups similar questions together
  1. Demonstration sampling: Picks representative questions and creates reasoning chains
- Uses simple heuristics like question length and reasoning step count

#### 4. Self-Consistency

- Samples multiple, diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT
- Selects the most consistent answer from generations
- Enhances reliability by ensuring logical soundness of generated paths

#### 5. Multimodal CoT (2024 Development)

- Brings together language and visual data
- Works in two stages:
  1. Rationale generation: Processes language and image inputs
  1. Answer inference: Combines rationale with original inputs
- Developed by Meta and AWS researchers

### Performance Insights

- CoT is considered an emergent ability that improves with model size
- Larger models perform better due to nuanced reasoning patterns learned from massive datasets
- Zero-Shot CoT is less effective than Few-Shot CoT for complex reasoning tasks

## Advanced Techniques

### Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

- Maintains a tree of thoughts representing coherent language sequences
- Enables self-evaluation of progress through intermediate thoughts
- Combines with search algorithms (BFS, DFS) for systematic exploration
- Key features:
  - Explores multiple reasoning paths simultaneously
  - Enables lookahead and backtracking
  - Success rate increases from low to 74% when breadth increases from 1 to 5
  - Ideal for problems requiring creative thinking and exploration

### Graph of Thoughts (GoT)

- Models information as arbitrary graphs where:
  - Vertices represent "LLM thoughts"
  - Edges represent dependencies between thoughts
- Advantages over ToT:
  - Enables combining arbitrary thoughts into synergistic outcomes
  - Distills essence of whole networks of thoughts
  - Enhances thoughts using feedback loops
  - 62% quality improvement over ToT in sorting tasks
  - 31% cost reduction compared to ToT

### Algorithm of Thoughts (AoT)

- Referenced in research but limited detailed information available in 2024
- Represents another evolution in structured reasoning approaches

### Step-Back Prompting

- Pushes model to think at a high level before diving into specifics
- Outperforms chain-of-thought prompting by up to 36% in some cases
- Better for tasks requiring abstract reasoning before detailed execution

## Structured Output Formats

### JSON Schema Integration

- JSON Schema plays vital role in LLMs for structured outputs
- OpenAI's gpt-4o-2024-08-06 achieves 100% success rate on complex JSON schema following
- Key benefits:
  - Well-established standard familiar to developers
  - Defines data types, required fields, format constraints
  - Prevents errors and facilitates interoperability

### Grammar-Based Decoding

- Form of constrained decoding using formal grammar rules
- Actively guides generation process with allowed sequence rules
- Two main implementation categories:
  1. Training-Time Techniques (TTT): Applied during training/post-training
  1. Inference-Time Techniques (ITT): Applied during inference phase

### Alternative Formats

#### XML

- Recommended by Anthropic for structuring prompts
- Increases consistency in outputs
- Particularly effective with Claude models

#### TSV/CSV

- Token-efficient for tabular data
- Uses fewer tokens than JSON for same data
- Limited to lists of records without nested structures

#### Columnar JSON

- Keys appear once instead of per record
- Supports nested data structures
- More token-efficient than standard JSON

### Best Practices

1. Explicitly request output format in prompts
1. State intended use of structured output
1. Use system prompts for format instructions
1. Validate outputs with tools like Pydantic
1. Consider performance vs. token usage trade-offs

## Anti-Hallucination Techniques

### Current State (2024)

- Hallucination rates in public LLMs: 3-16%
- Major causes:
  - Model attempting to be overly helpful
  - Lack of proper grounding and context
  - Training data inaccuracies and biases
  - Design prioritizing fluency over factual accuracy

### Key Techniques

#### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- Combines LLM capabilities with external information sources
- Retrieves relevant context before generation
- Grounds outputs in factual evidence
- Reduces speculation and fabrication

#### 2. "According to..." Prompting

- Directs LLMs to ground responses using pre-training data
- Inspired by journalistic practice of citing sources
- Example: "According to Wikipedia..."
- Significantly reduces unsupported claims

#### 3. Contextual Grounding

- Uses modern guardrails supporting contextual grounding
- Checks factual accuracy against sources
- Flags ungrounded information in responses
- Ensures outputs align with provided context

#### 4. Step-Back Prompting

- Higher accuracy and lower hallucination rates than CoT
- Forces high-level thinking before details
- Particularly effective for complex reasoning tasks

#### 5. Human Oversight

- Subject matter expert validation
- Critical for sensitive/high-risk applications
- Identifies and corrects hallucinations before dissemination

### Implementation Best Practices

1. Combine multiple techniques for best results
1. Use few-shot prompting with factually grounded examples
1. Implement proper error handling for no-result scenarios
1. Explicitly encode evidentiary and logical requirements
1. Calibrate uncertainty in model responses
