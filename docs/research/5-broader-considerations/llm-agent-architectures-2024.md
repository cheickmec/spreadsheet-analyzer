## Core Agent Architectures

### 1. ReAct Pattern and Recent Developments

#### Original Architecture

ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) synergizes reasoning traces with action execution, allowing LLMs to generate both verbal reasoning traces and actions in an interleaved manner.

#### Critical Analysis (2024)

- **"On the Brittle Foundations of ReAct Prompting"** (arxiv:2405.13966, May 2024)
  - Found that performance is minimally influenced by interleaving reasoning traces with actions
  - 40-90% of actions after "think" tags were invalid depending on the model
  - Performance driven more by exemplar-query similarity than reasoning abilities

#### Recent Improvements

- **StateAct** (arxiv:2410.02810, October 2024)

  - Adds self-prompting mechanism to maintain goal focus
  - Introduces "chain-of-states" for better context tracking
  - Performance improvements: 10% on Alfworld, 30% on Textcraft, 7% on Webshop over ReAct

- **RAISE Method**

  - Adds short-term and long-term memory components
  - Outperforms ReAct in efficiency and output quality
  - Better context retention in longer conversations

### 2. Plan-and-Execute Architectures

#### Core Components

1. **Planner**: Generates multi-step plans for complex tasks
1. **Executor(s)**: Execute individual steps with tool access
1. **Re-planning**: Dynamic adjustment based on execution results

#### Key Advantages

- **Speed**: Multi-step workflows execute faster with fewer LLM calls
- **Cost**: Smaller models for execution, larger only for planning
- **Performance**: Better task completion rates through explicit planning

#### Notable Implementations

- **LLMCompiler** (Kim et al., 2024)

  - Streams DAG of tasks with dependencies
  - Parallel execution capabilities
  - Surpasses OpenAI's parallel tool calling performance

- **Magentic One** (Microsoft/AutoGen)

  - Multi-agent architecture with Orchestrator
  - Specialized agents for web, files, and code execution
  - Dynamic error recovery and re-planning

### 3. Tree of Thoughts (ToT) Reasoning

#### Architecture Overview

- Maintains tree of coherent thought sequences
- Self-evaluation of intermediate thoughts
- Search algorithms (BFS/DFS) for systematic exploration

#### Performance Metrics

- Game of 24: 74% success rate (vs 4% for CoT)
- Significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks

#### Implementations

- **Official**: princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm
- **Alternative**: kyegomez/tree-of-thoughts (70%+ reasoning improvement claims)
