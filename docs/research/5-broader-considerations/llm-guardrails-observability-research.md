## 1. Safety Mechanisms and Guardrails

### Overview

Guardrails for LLMs are predefined rules, limitations, and operational protocols that govern the behavior and outputs of AI systems. They serve as safety controls that monitor and dictate user interactions with LLM applications.

### Key Categories

#### Input Guardrails

- Applied before LLM processing
- Intercept incoming inputs for safety assessment
- Required for user-facing applications
- Focus on preventing prompt injection and malicious inputs

#### Output Guardrails

- Retry generation if issues detected
- Filter for bias, toxicity, and data leakage
- Ensure compliance with security policies

### Common Vulnerabilities Addressed

1. **Prompt Injection**: Malicious inputs designed to manipulate prompts
1. **Jailbreaking**: Attempts to bypass safety restrictions
1. **Data Leakage**: Exposure of personal identifiable information
