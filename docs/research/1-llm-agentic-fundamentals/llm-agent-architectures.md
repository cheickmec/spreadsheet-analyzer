# LLM Agent Architectures

## Executive Summary

LLM Agent Architectures represent the foundational patterns for building intelligent systems that can reason, plan, and execute tasks autonomously. In the context of Excel analysis, these architectures enable agents to understand complex spreadsheet structures, analyze formulas, detect patterns, and provide insights. This document covers the latest developments in agent architectures (2023-2024), including ReAct, Plan-and-Execute, Tree of Thoughts, and advanced memory systems.

## Current State of the Art

### Overview of Agent Architecture Evolution

The field has evolved rapidly from simple prompt-based interactions to sophisticated multi-step reasoning systems:

1. **2023**: Introduction of ReAct pattern, early tool-use implementations
1. **Early 2024**: Critical analyses revealing limitations, emergence of improved patterns
1. **Late 2024**: Industry standardization (MCP), production deployments, multi-agent dominance

Current benchmarks show:

- Best agents achieve ~35% success on comprehensive data analysis tasks
- 51% of development teams have agents in production
- Token usage optimization is the primary performance factor

## Key Technologies and Frameworks

### 1. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Pattern

**Description**: Interleaves reasoning traces with action execution, allowing agents to think through problems step-by-step.

**Latest Improvements (2024)**:

- **StateAct**: Maintains persistent state information between steps
- **RAISE**: Introduces reflection loops for self-correction
- **Dynamic prompting**: Adjusts reasoning depth based on task complexity

**Pros**:

- Interpretable reasoning traces
- Natural error recovery through reflection
- Flexible integration with tools

**Cons**:

- Can get stuck in reasoning loops
- Token-intensive for complex tasks
- Performance degrades with long contexts

**Example Implementation**:

```python
class ReActAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm, tools):
        self.llm = llm
        self.tools = tools
        self.max_iterations = 10

    def run(self, task):
        thought_action_history = []

        for i in range(self.max_iterations):
            # Generate thought
            thought = self.llm.generate_thought(task, thought_action_history)

            # Decide on action
            action = self.llm.decide_action(thought, self.tools)

            # Execute action
            observation = self.execute_action(action)

            thought_action_history.append({
                "thought": thought,
                "action": action,
                "observation": observation
            })

            # Check if task is complete
            if self.is_task_complete(observation, task):
                return self.format_final_answer(thought_action_history)

        return "Max iterations reached"
```

### 2. Plan-and-Execute Architecture

**Description**: Separates planning from execution, creating a high-level plan before executing individual steps.

**Key Components**:

- **Planner**: Decomposes tasks into subtasks
- **Executor**: Carries out individual steps
- **Replanner**: Adjusts plan based on execution results

**Pros**:

- Better for complex, multi-step tasks
- Reduces token usage through focused execution
- Allows for plan optimization and parallelization

**Cons**:

- Less flexible for dynamic environments
- Requires good initial task understanding
- Plan quality heavily impacts success

**Implementation Pattern**:

```python
class PlanAndExecuteAgent:
    def __init__(self, planner_llm, executor_llm, tools):
        self.planner = planner_llm
        self.executor = executor_llm
        self.tools = tools

    def run(self, task):
        # Generate initial plan
        plan = self.planner.create_plan(task)

        results = []
        for step in plan:
            # Execute step
            result = self.executor.execute_step(step, self.tools, results)
            results.append(result)

            # Check if replanning needed
            if self.should_replan(result, plan):
                plan = self.planner.replan(task, results, plan)

        return self.synthesize_results(results)
```

### 3. Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

**Description**: Explores multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, evaluating and pruning branches.

**Search Strategies**:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all options at each level
- **Beam Search**: Keeps only top-k most promising paths
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search**: Balances exploration and exploitation

**Pros**:

- Excellent for problems with multiple valid approaches
- Can backtrack from dead-ends
- Provides reasoning confidence scores

**Cons**:

- Extremely token-intensive
- Computational overhead for tree management
- May overthink simple problems

**Performance**:

- 74% success rate on Game of 24 (vs 4% for standard prompting)
- Effective for mathematical reasoning and puzzle-solving

### 4. Memory Systems

Modern agents require sophisticated memory systems for context retention and learning:

#### Episodic Memory

- Stores specific interactions and experiences
- Enables learning from past successes/failures
- Critical for personalization

#### Semantic Memory

- General knowledge about domains and concepts
- Pre-trained knowledge + learned facts
- Updated through experience

#### Procedural Memory

- Learned patterns and strategies
- Optimized action sequences
- Task-specific heuristics

**Implementation Example**:

```python
class AgentMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.episodic = VectorStore()  # For specific experiences
        self.semantic = KnowledgeGraph() # For facts and relationships
        self.procedural = StrategyCache() # For learned procedures

    def remember_interaction(self, interaction):
        # Store in episodic memory
        self.episodic.add(interaction)

        # Extract facts for semantic memory
        facts = self.extract_facts(interaction)
        self.semantic.update(facts)

        # Learn procedural patterns
        if interaction.successful:
            self.procedural.reinforce(interaction.strategy)
```

## Excel-Specific Applications

### 1. Formula Analysis Agent

```python
class ExcelFormulaAnalyzer(ReActAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            tools=[
                ParseFormulaTool(),
                TraceDependenciesTool(),
                ValidateCalculationTool(),
                DetectCircularReferenceTool()
            ]
        )

    def analyze_workbook(self, workbook):
        return self.run(f"Analyze all formulas in {workbook} for errors and optimization opportunities")
```

### 2. Data Pattern Recognition

- Uses Tree of Thoughts to explore multiple pattern hypotheses
- Maintains semantic memory of common Excel patterns
- Learns procedural memory for efficient analysis

### 3. Report Generation Pipeline

- Plan-and-Execute architecture for structured reports
- Episodic memory for user preferences
- Tool integration for charts and formatting

## Implementation Examples

import pandas as pd
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

class ExcelAnalysisAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm):
        self.llm = llm
        self.memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
        self.tools = self._initialize_tools()

    def _initialize_tools(self):
        return [
            ExcelReaderTool(),
            FormulaAnalyzerTool(),
            DataValidatorTool(),
            ChartGeneratorTool(),
            PivotTableCreatorTool()
        ]

    def analyze_spreadsheet(self, file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # ReAct-style analysis
        analysis_prompt = f"""
        Analyze the Excel file at {file_path}:
        1. Thought: First, I need to understand the structure
        2. Action: Read file and identify sheets
        3. Observation: [File contents]
        4. Thought: Now analyze formulas for errors
        5. Action: Check all formulas
        ...
        """

        result = self.llm.invoke(analysis_prompt)
        self.memory.save_context({"input": file_path}, {"output": result})

        return {
            "summary": result.summary,
            "issues": result.issues,
            "recommendations": result.recommendations
        }
```
