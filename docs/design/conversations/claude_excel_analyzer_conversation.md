Reimagined agent-driven data loading with flexible kernel approach.

## Assistant

You're absolutely right! I was getting too focused on pre-loading everything into shared memory, when the design philosophy is actually about giving agents the freedom to explore and load data as they need it. The agents should have full control over what they load and when.

Let me reconsider the architecture with this in mind:

1. Each agent gets a Jupyter kernel with libraries pre-installed
1. They can use pandas, openpyxl, or any other library as they see fit
1. We do some deterministic analysis upfront (formula graphs, etc.) and provide that as context
1. The agents decide what data to load, how to load it, and what to analyze

This is much more aligned with the exploratory, agent-driven approach they originally described. The idempotent notebook just needs to ensure the file path is available and any deterministic pre-analysis is accessible.

You're absolutely right! I apologize for overcomplicating this. The beauty of your design is that agents have **full autonomy** to explore the data as they see fit. Let me refocus on what actually matters for your architecture:

## The Correct Architecture

### What Gets Pre-computed (Deterministic)

```python
# Orchestrator runs ONCE, before creating agents:
wb = load_workbook(file_path, read_only=True)

deterministic_context = {
    'formula_graph': build_formula_dependency_graph(wb),
    'sheet_dimensions': {sheet: (ws.max_row, ws.max_column) for sheet, ws in wb.items()},
    'cell_types_map': analyze_cell_types(wb),
    'named_ranges': extract_named_ranges(wb),
    'external_links': find_external_references(wb),
    # ... other deterministic analysis
}

# This becomes part of the LLM's initial context
```

### What Each Agent Gets (Bootstrap Cell)

```python
# --- Agent Bootstrap Cell (Idempotent) ---
from pathlib import Path
import openpyxl
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Constants injected by orchestrator
EXCEL_FILE = Path("/path/to/file.xlsx")
SHEET_NAME = "Sales"
AGENT_ID = "agent_sales_7b3d"

# Agent can reload whenever needed
def load_workbook():
    """Load the full workbook with openpyxl"""
    return openpyxl.load_workbook(EXCEL_FILE, read_only=True, data_only=True)

def load_range(range_str="A1:Z100", **kwargs):
    """Load a specific range with pandas"""
    return pd.read_excel(
        EXCEL_FILE,
        sheet_name=SHEET_NAME,
        usecols=range_str.split(":")[0][0] + ":" + range_str.split(":")[1][0],
        engine='openpyxl',
        **kwargs
    )

def load_full_sheet(**kwargs):
    """Load entire sheet with pandas"""
    return pd.read_excel(EXCEL_FILE, sheet_name=SHEET_NAME, engine='openpyxl', **kwargs)

# Make deterministic context available
import json
FORMULA_CONTEXT = json.loads('''{{ formula_context }}''')  # Injected by orchestrator

print(f"Agent {AGENT_ID} ready to analyze {SHEET_NAME}")
print(f"Sheet has {FORMULA_CONTEXT['sheet_dimensions'][SHEET_NAME]} cells")
```

### Agent Freedom Examples

```python
# Agent can choose to load nothing initially
# Just inspect formulas from context

# Or load a sample
df_sample = load_range("A1:E10")

# Or check specific columns
df_col_b = pd.read_excel(EXCEL_FILE, sheet_name=SHEET_NAME, usecols="B")

# Or use openpyxl directly for cell-by-cell analysis
wb = load_workbook()
ws = wb[SHEET_NAME]
for row in ws.iter_rows(min_row=1, max_row=5):
    # Custom logic
```

## Why This Is Better

1. **True Agent Autonomy**: Agents decide what/when/how to load data
1. **Minimal Memory Footprint**: Only load what's needed
1. **Simple & Idempotent**: Just file paths and helper functions
1. **Flexible Exploration**: Agents can iterate, sample, validate as they choose

## The Document's Point About Page Caching

They're right that with `read_only=True` and modern SSDs, repeatedly opening the same file is fast because:

- OS caches the file in RAM
- openpyxl in read-only mode streams data
- No parsing happens until you access specific sheets/cells

So agents can freely call `load_workbook()` or `pd.read_excel()` without significant overhead.

## Example Agent Workflow

```python
# Cell 1: Bootstrap (as above)

# Cell 2: Agent decides to check for patterns
# "I'll sample every 100th row to look for patterns"
df_sample = pd.read_excel(
    EXCEL_FILE,
    sheet_name=SHEET_NAME,
    skiprows=lambda x: x % 100 != 0
)

# Cell 3: Agent finds interesting column
# "Column D looks like it has formulas, let me investigate"
wb = load_workbook()
ws = wb[SHEET_NAME]
col_d_formulas = [
    cell.value for cell in ws['D']
    if hasattr(cell, 'formula') and cell.formula
]

# Cell 4: Agent decides to load specific data
# "Now I need the full column D with its dependencies"
df_deps = load_range("A:E")  # Columns A-E
```

## This Aligns With Your Original Vision

- ✅ Agents have full control
- ✅ Notebooks are idempotent (just paths and functions)
- ✅ No pre-loading of data
- ✅ Efficient use of OS caching
- ✅ Simple to implement and understand

The shared memory approach I proposed earlier makes more sense for scenarios where you're doing heavy pre-processing or have multiple agents needing the exact same large dataset. For your exploratory, agent-driven analysis, the simpler file-based approach with agent autonomy is definitely the way to go.
