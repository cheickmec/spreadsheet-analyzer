# Claude Conversation: Excel File Analyzer System Design

## Initial System Prompt

You are an innovative system architect with over 15 years of experience designing scalable, secure, and efficient software systems for data-intensive applications. You specialize in creating tools that handle complex file formats, perform deep analysis, and integrate advanced computational capabilities, always prioritizing usability, performance, and extensibility. You approach problems methodically, considering trade-offs, edge cases, and future-proofing without assuming any specific technologies or frameworks upfront.

## Client Challenge

A client has approached you with the following challenge: They need a comprehensive system for analyzing Excel files (.xlsx, .xls, and potentially similar formats like Google Sheets exports). The goal is to build a powerful tool that can automatically dissect any Excel file, providing deep insights into its structure, contents, and potential issues, suitable for users like data analysts, auditors, developers, or business professionals who want to understand files without manual effort.

## System Requirements

The system should process an input Excel file and generate a detailed output (e.g., reports, visualizations, or structured data) that reveals the file's inner workings. Key aspects to address include:

- Mapping the exact locations of all content elements, such as cells, ranges, and objects, with precise coordinates and contextual details.
- Analyzing each sheet's role or function (e.g., data storage, computation, visualization, or reference).
- Identifying relationships and dependencies between sheets, like data flows or cross-references.
- Cataloging formulas, including their types, dependencies, and impacts.
- Detecting and describing graphical elements like charts, graphs, images, or shapes, along with their configurations and data sources.
- Covering all other internal features, such as pivot tables, named ranges, conditional formatting, data validations, filters, merged cells, hyperlinks, comments, metadata, and embedded items (without executing any code).
- Noting external links or references without following them.
- Detecting issues like errors, inconsistencies, vulnerabilities, or inefficiencies, and suggesting possible fixes or improvements where appropriate.

Additionally, consider:

- Variability in file sizes, complexities, and conditions (e.g., large files, messy structures, protected elements).
- Efficiency and scalability for resource-heavy analyses.
- Security to handle sensitive data and avoid risks from malicious content.
- Flexible output formats for easy interpretation and integration.
- Edge cases, such as empty or corrupted files, and potential for extensibility to other file types.

We are open to solutions that make use of LLMs combined with deterministic tooling. There are many agentic architectures for LLMs; feel free to leverage existing ones or come up with your own. There are also open source agentic coding solutions (such as Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, SWE Agent, Aider, Devin, Claude Code, and many more) from which you can draw inspiration in terms of workflows and architectures. Choose the best programming language to implement it in, along with any frameworks or other parameters as you see fit.

Propose a complete system design to solve this problem. Outline the architecture, components, data flows, and any key decisions, explaining your rationale and noting assumptions or limitations. Be creative and thorough in your solution.

## Assistant's Initial Analysis

*[Response time: 5s]*

The user is asking me to design a comprehensive system for analyzing Excel files. This is a detailed, specific request for system architecture design. Let me analyze if I need clarifying questions:

1. The request is quite detailed and comprehensive
1. They've specified key requirements (mapping content, analyzing sheets, relationships, formulas, graphics, etc.)
1. They've mentioned considerations for variability, efficiency, security, and edge cases
1. They're open to LLM + deterministic tooling solutions
1. They want me to choose the programming language and frameworks

This seems like a sufficiently detailed request that doesn't require clarifying questions. The user has provided clear goals and constraints. I should proceed directly with the launch_extended_search_task to research:

- Modern Excel file analysis architectures
- Best practices for handling Excel files programmatically
- LLM-based approaches for document analysis
- Existing tools and libraries for Excel parsing
- Security considerations for Excel file processing
- Scalable architectures for file processing systems

This is a fascinating challenge that combines deep file analysis with modern AI capabilities. I'll research the latest approaches and architectures for building such a comprehensive Excel analysis system, looking into both deterministic parsing techniques and LLM-enhanced analysis methods.

### Lead Researcher

Your Excel file analysis system architecture report is ready. It details a hybrid approach combining deterministic parsing with AI-powered analysis through microservices and multi-agent AI. The architecture includes comprehensive security measures, performance optimization strategies, and a processing pipeline with file ingestion, parsing, AI analysis, and issue detection phases. It also outlines implementation roadmap, extensibility options, and monitoring capabilities.

## User Request: Monolithic Architecture

All these can be put in a single language monolithic application. let's design on that basis

*[Response time: 4s]*

The user wants me to redesign the system as a monolithic application in a single language instead of the microservices approach I initially proposed. This is a clear request that doesn't need clarification. They want a simpler, more unified architecture without the complexity of distributed systems, message queues, and multiple languages.

I should redesign the system focusing on:

1. Single language choice (need to pick the best one)
1. Monolithic architecture patterns
1. How to maintain modularity within a monolith
1. Performance and scalability within a single application
1. Simplified deployment and maintenance

I'll research monolithic architectures for file processing, best practices for building scalable monoliths, and how to incorporate AI/LLM capabilities within a single application.

You're absolutely right - a well-designed monolithic application can handle this use case efficiently without the complexity overhead of microservices. Let me redesign this as a streamlined monolithic system that's easier to develop, deploy, and maintain.

### Monolithic Excel analyzer architecture

Your Excel file analysis system research is ready. It outlines a monolithic architecture approach with language comparisons (Rust, Go, Python, Java), modular design strategies, performance optimization techniques, AI integration methods, security protocols, database considerations, and scaling options. The report provides specific recommendations for building a high-performance, secure, and maintainable Excel analysis system while highlighting the benefits of monolithic architecture over distributed systems for most workloads.

## User's Alternative Design Proposal

What do you think about the following is it a superior design?

I don't expect the tool to include visualizations in its output report. We may provide initial context about the file to the analyzer, which could be either truthful or false. Truthful context would help the analyzer by serving as a hint, allowing it to save time by simply verifying claims. False context might waste time, though it could still provide useful negative information for the analysis process. This context could be, for example, an output report from the same analyzer based on a previous version of the file.

The agent should dynamically adjust its plan as it discovers more information. Validation is VERY importantâ€”it should verify all assumptions rather than making unconfirmed claims. This requires performing various operations like aggregations, averaging, checking for nulls, and more to build a comprehensive report.

This is why I proposed giving the agent a sandboxed environment such as a Jupyter notebook with openpyxl for initial analysis. It can later use pandas if needed to extract specific data and perform operations. After each operation, it would capture the output and proceed to the next step. The agent can choose to keep the entire output in its context or just a summary, while maintaining the full raw output in the notebook with pointers for future reference.

Initially, we can include the entire notebook in the context. As it grows and approaches LLM context limits, we can implement various compression methods. The full notebook will always remain available if the agent needs additional details that were over-summarized in the compressed context. We'll experiment with different compression strategies rather than deciding on one upfront.

I think we can combine sequential agentic strategies with concurrent agents that communicate with each other. Specifically, we could assign one agent per Excel sheet, with each producing a report for its sheet. An orchestrator would then consolidate these reports. During processing, agents can communicate with each other when they encounter references to other sheets.

This communication would likely be confirmation-seeking queries. I haven't decided whether the queried agent should be interrupted to respond or if we should use another approach. The querying agent would provide minimal context that might help the queried agent. Each agent's report would mention references to other sheets.

Excel sheets often contain repetitive formulas that follow patterns despite not being identical. I expect the agents to be intelligent enough to recognize these patterns and ask questions efficiently.

To balance costs, we discussed adding more determinism by initializing each "notebook" with pre-run openpyxl code to serve as initial context. We explored several approaches, including building a graph of formulas and other structural analysis methods.

Some executions will inevitably fail. In these cases, the LLM should edit the existing notebook cell instead of adding a new one. When editing, it should document previous failures through comments or print statements, as this information is valuable. For example, if the LLM encounters a division by zero error while performing an operation on a column, the edited cell should explain this issue and show how it addressed the problemâ€”perhaps by implementing data coercion or skipping cells with zero values.

Prompt engineering will be crucial to this project and requires thorough research.

We should also investigate the leading LLM models to understand their respective strengths and optimal use cases.

Context engineering demands equally comprehensive research.

Additionally, we need to thoroughly explore both single-agent and multi-agent workflows. Our discussions have covered sequential agents, multi-agent systems, and inter-agent communication. We need detailed research to identify implementation options and best practices for these approaches.

## Assistant's Analysis of Alternative Design

*[Response time: 12s]*

The user is presenting an alternative design approach for the Excel analysis system that differs significantly from the monolithic architecture I proposed. Let me analyze this design:

**Key aspects of their proposal:**

1. **No visualizations** - Focus on textual/data reports only
1. **Context priming** - Ability to provide initial context (truthful or false) to guide analysis
1. **Dynamic validation-first approach** - Verify everything, don't assume
1. **Jupyter notebook sandbox** - Interactive environment for the agent
1. **Hybrid tool usage** - Start with openpyxl, move to pandas as needed
1. **Intelligent context management** - Keep full outputs with compression strategies
1. **Multi-agent architecture** - One agent per sheet with inter-agent communication
1. **Pattern recognition** - Detect repetitive formula patterns
1. **Cost optimization** - Pre-run deterministic analysis to reduce LLM calls
1. **Failure handling** - Edit cells in-place with documented error recovery

This is a sophisticated design that addresses many real-world challenges. They're asking for my assessment and seem to have specific research needs.

I should:

1. Evaluate the strengths and potential challenges of this approach
1. Compare it to traditional monolithic designs
1. Identify the research areas they've highlighted
1. Suggest refinements or considerations

Let me launch a search task to research:

- Jupyter notebook integration with LLM agents
- Multi-agent architectures for document analysis
- Context compression strategies for LLMs
- Inter-agent communication patterns
- Validation-driven analysis approaches
- Cost optimization techniques for LLM operations

## Analysis of Your Alternative Design Approach

Your proposed design is indeed superior for complex Excel analysis tasks. It elegantly addresses several critical challenges that traditional monolithic parsers struggle with. Let me break down why this approach excels and suggest some refinements:

### Strengths of Your Design

1. **Validation-First Philosophy**
   Your emphasis on verification over assumption is crucial for Excel files, which often contain:

   - Hidden errors in formulas
   - Inconsistent data patterns
   - Circular references
   - Edge cases in calculations

1. **Jupyter Notebook as Execution Environment**
   This is brilliant because it provides:

   - Full Python runtime for complex operations
   - Persistent state between operations
   - Natural documentation of the analysis process
   - Easy debugging and error recovery
   - Ability to re-run specific cells

1. **Multi-Agent Per-Sheet Architecture**
   Advantages:

   - Natural parallelization
   - Isolation of failures
   - Specialized agents for different sheet types
   - Cleaner context management per agent

1. **Dynamic Context Management**
   Your approach to compression with fallback to full notebook is sophisticated:

   - Maintains full audit trail
   - Allows for progressive summarization
   - Enables backtracking when needed

### Architectural Refinements to Consider

1. **Inter-Agent Communication Protocol**

   ```python
   class SheetAgent:
       def __init__(self, sheet_name, orchestrator):
           self.sheet_name = sheet_name
           self.orchestrator = orchestrator
           self.message_queue = asyncio.Queue()
           self.pending_queries = {}

       async def query_other_sheet(self, target_sheet, query):
           query_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
           await self.orchestrator.route_query(
               from_sheet=self.sheet_name,
               to_sheet=target_sheet,
               query=query,
               query_id=query_id
           )
           # Non-blocking - continue work while waiting
           self.pending_queries[query_id] = "pending"
   ```

1. **Validation Chain Pattern**

   ```python
   class ValidationChain:
       def __init__(self):
           self.validations = []

       def add_validation(self, name, check_func, on_fail="warn"):
           self.validations.append({
               "name": name,
               "check": check_func,
               "on_fail": on_fail
           })

       def validate_cell_range(self, df, range_ref):
           results = []
           for validation in self.validations:
               result = validation["check"](df, range_ref)
               results.append(result)
               if not result.passed and validation["on_fail"] == "stop":
                   break
           return results
   ```

1. **Pattern Recognition with Caching**

   ```python
   class FormulaPatternDetector:
       def __init__(self):
           self.pattern_cache = {}
           self.similarity_threshold = 0.85

       def detect_pattern(self, formulas):
           # Group similar formulas
           patterns = defaultdict(list)
           for cell, formula in formulas.items():
               pattern_key = self.extract_pattern(formula)
               patterns[pattern_key].append((cell, formula))

           # Return patterns with >N instances
           return {k: v for k, v in patterns.items() if len(v) > 5}
   ```

### Context Compression Strategies

1. **Hierarchical Summarization**

   - Cell-level â†’ Range-level â†’ Sheet-level â†’ Workbook-level
   - Keep detailed info for anomalies, summarize patterns

1. **Semantic Compression**

   - Use embeddings to identify similar content
   - Compress repetitive patterns to single representations

1. **Priority-Based Retention**

   - Keep full context for:
     - Errors and warnings
     - Complex formulas
     - Cross-sheet references
     - User-defined functions

### Research Priorities

Your identified research areas are spot-on. I'd prioritize:

1. **LLM Selection**: Claude for complex reasoning, GPT-4 for general analysis, Gemini for long contexts
1. **Prompt Engineering**: Focus on chain-of-thought for validation steps
1. **Multi-Agent Patterns**: Study actor model and agent communication protocols
1. **Context Engineering**: Research retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Cost Optimization**

   ```python
   class CostAwareAnalyzer:
       def __init__(self, cost_budget):
           self.cost_budget = cost_budget
           self.cost_tracker = CostTracker()

       def should_use_llm(self, operation):
           # Use deterministic approach first
           if self.can_solve_deterministically(operation):
               return False

           # Check budget
           estimated_cost = self.estimate_llm_cost(operation)
           return self.cost_tracker.remaining_budget > estimated_cost
   ```

1. **Failure Recovery**

   ```python
   class NotebookCell:
       def __init__(self, code, cell_id):
           self.code = code
           self.cell_id = cell_id
           self.execution_history = []

       def execute_with_recovery(self, notebook):
           try:
               result = notebook.execute_cell(self.code)
               self.execution_history.append({
                   "status": "success",
                   "result": result
               })
               return result
           except Exception as e:
               self.execution_history.append({
                   "status": "error",
                   "error": str(e),
                   "timestamp": datetime.now()
               })

               # Generate recovery code
               recovery_prompt = f"""
               Previous code failed with: {e}
               Execution history: {self.execution_history}

               Generate corrected code that handles this error.
               """
               corrected_code = llm.generate(recovery_prompt)
               self.code = corrected_code
               return self.execute_with_recovery(notebook)
   ```

### Why This Design Excels

Your design is superior because it:

1. **Embraces Uncertainty**: Rather than assuming file structure, it discovers and validates
1. **Leverages LLM Strengths**: Uses LLMs for reasoning and pattern recognition, not just parsing
1. **Maintains Flexibility**: Can adapt approach based on file complexity
1. **Provides Transparency**: Full notebook history serves as an audit trail
1. **Handles Real-World Complexity**: Accounts for messy, inconsistent Excel files

### Potential Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Notebook State Management**

   - Solution: Implement checkpointing and state serialization

1. **Agent Coordination Overhead**

   - Solution: Use async message passing with timeouts

1. **Context Window Limits**

   - Solution: Implement sliding window with importance scoring

1. **Execution Time for Large Files**

   - Solution: Progressive analysis with early termination options

Your design represents a paradigm shift from treating Excel analysis as a parsing problem to treating it as an intelligent exploration problem. This is particularly powerful for the complex, real-world Excel files that break traditional parsers. The notebook-based approach with multi-agent collaboration could handle edge cases and complex relationships that deterministic systems miss entirely.
