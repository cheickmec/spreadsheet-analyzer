And here are some un-tested designs:

```
Below is a concrete blueprint for giving your File Intelligence pipeline the “agentic brain” you’re envisioning—one where deterministic “explorers” scan the surface, then a tightly-governed LLM layer writes code, walks ranges, and publishes facts.  The design borrows proven ideas from frameworks such as LangGraph and AutoGen, plus lessons from the current **fileintel-prototype** (e.g., Stage-1 filename/MIME hints, FileCard schema, Agent Tool Bus).
## Key takeaway (summary)

Explorers should stay deterministic—hashing, format sniffing, security checks—while **specialised LLM agents run in a sandboxed, auditable Tool Bus** that lets them: (1) call a rich library of *read\_* functions (e.g., `read_sheet_range`, `read_pdf_page`), (2) incrementally summarise chunks so context never explodes, (3) auto-generate & test extraction code (Python/SQL) against built-in validators, and (4) stream verified facts into FileCards and PersonaGraph.  Guard-rails (rate limits, policy checks) keep autonomy safe and costs bounded.  The gaps today are mostly orchestration, memory management, and specific range utilities—solvable with existing open-source pieces and a few internal services.

## 1  Who does what?

| Layer                     | Scope                                            | Deterministic? | AI?   | Notes                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stage-0 → 2 Explorers** | hash, MIME, provider hints, macro flags          | ✅              | ❌     | Already implemented in prototype; filename/MIME heuristics feed confidence scores  |
| **Structural Parsers**    | enumerate sheets, tables, ranges, pages          | ✅              | ❌     | Use openpyxl, pdfplumber, Tika etc.                                                |
| **LLM Agents (Stage-4+)** | classification, code generation, fact extraction | ⚠️             | ✅     | Run via Tool Bus with guard-rails  & policy layer                                  |
| **FileCard Builder**      | merge raw text, AI summaries, key facts          | Mixed          | Mixed | See FileCard entity spec                                                           |

### Why keep explorers deterministic?

* Early exits save tokens: a large duplicate PDF is skipped long before any LLM runs.
* Security: VBA or App Script detected → route to sandbox rather than ChatGPT.

## 2  LLM sandbox & Tool Bus

* **Code Interpreter**: expose a *local* Python sandbox modelled on OpenAI’s Code Interpreter (runs 30 s, 512 MB RAM, no network).
* **Tool Registry**: every callable (`read_sheet_range`, `list_sheets`, `write_fact`) is described in JSON Schema; LangGraph’s guarded-edge pattern lets you add human-in-the-loop moderation if autonomy > N%.
* **Multi-Agent Patterns**: borrow AutoGen’s “planner+worker+critic” loop so one agent writes code, another evaluates output, a third decides if more context is needed.  This matches ADR-022’s vision of a secure, auditable Tool Bus .

## 3  Range-based reading & summarisation

1. **Read utilities**

* `read_sheet_range(sheet_id, "A1:F500")` → pandas DF (openpyxl pattern)
* `read_pdf_page(file_id, 3)` → text & bbox.
* These wrappers hide library quirks and emit *ExtractionUnit* objects with lineage coordinates.

2. **Hierarchical chunking**

* Explorers tag logical units (sheet, table, paragraph).
* Agents use *recursive/hierarchical chunking* so they never exceed context: see LongRefiner (2025) and typical RAG chunking guides.

3. **Streaming summariser**

* After each chunk parse, agent sends a *summary-patch* to a token-limited scratchpad (map-reduce / “collapse” pattern).
* This running précis plus FileCard history provides memory.

## 4  Auto-generated extractors

* **CodeGenerator service** (design already sketched in prototype) .
* Flow: LLM writes code → validator runs unit tests → if pass, tool is packaged and versioned.
* Compile-once-run-many amortises cost for repetitive forms (e.g., one bank CSV template).

## 5  Memory & knowledge graph updates

* When agent closes a FileCard, it emits **FinancialFact** nodes; Tool Bus moderates and commits to PersonaGraph.
* Deduplication/confidence logic already outlined in Chronicle update function .

## 6  Safety, cost & governance

* **Budget Enforcement**: per-agent token + CPU budgets enforced by Tool Bus (rate-limit config in ADR-022) .
* **Sandbox**: no network, no file system outside `/sandbox`, path traversal rules etc. (see prototype security list) .
* **Explain-ability**: every fact stores source range/page offset so auditors can replay extraction.

## 7  Gaps & improvements

| Gap                           | Proposal                                                           | Rationale                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Spreadsheet macro risk**    | Auto-flag `.xlsm` & run `olevba` offline before LLM                | Prevent prompt/macro injection.          |
| **Google Sheets Apps Script** | Use Drive API to list bound scripts, raise Trust Tier              | LLM can decide to ignore or inspect.     |
| **Vector feedback loop**      | Embed failed extraction cases and retrain few-shot prompts nightly | Reduces hallucination, increases recall. |
| **Performance metrics**       | Log per-agent wall time & tokens, feed cost dashboard              | Supports budget governance.              |
| **Synthetic test corpus**     | Generate red-team docs (zip bombs, misleading headers) for CI      | Keeps pipeline robust.                   |

---

## 8  Roadmap snapshot

1. **Week 1-2**  Ship range-reader tools (`read_sheet_range`, `read_pdf_page`).
2. **Week 3-4**  Integrate Code Interpreter sandbox & Tool Bus policies.
3. **Week 5**  Roll out planner/worker/critic AutoGen loop for complex docs.
4. **Week 6+**  Continuous evaluation set; cost KPIs; human-in-the-loop UI.

---

### Bottom line

Your instinct is correct: deterministic explorers alone aren’t enough; but giving an LLM raw files without structure is wasteful.  A **two-layer design—“structured explorers + sandboxed agent coders”**—delivers precision, safety, and scalability.  Most building blocks already exist in your prototype and in the open-source ecosystem; the main work is stitching them together under a governed Tool Bus and enriching them with smart range utilities and hierarchical summarisation.  Implement these pieces, and you unlock fully autonomous, auditable extraction with predictable cost.

```

```

```

Of course. Here is a comprehensive system design for the Excel analysis tool.

### **System Architecture: "ExcelQuant"**

**ExcelQuant** is a modular, scalable, and secure system designed for the deep analysis of spreadsheet files. It employs a hybrid architecture, combining deterministic parsing for structural accuracy with Large Language Models (LLMs) for nuanced, human-like interpretation and insight generation. The system is designed to be a cloud-native, containerized application, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

______________________________________________________________________

### **Core Principles**

- **Accuracy First:** Deterministic tools will form the bedrock of the analysis, ensuring factual correctness for elements like cell values, formulas, and object locations.
- **Insightful Interpretation:** LLMs will be used to analyze less structured data, such as the purpose of a sheet, the complexity of formulas, and potential inconsistencies.
- **Security by Design:** All components will operate within a secure, sandboxed environment to handle sensitive data and mitigate risks from potentially malicious files.
- **Scalability and Performance:** The architecture will support asynchronous processing and be horizontally scalable to handle varying workloads, from small files to massive, complex spreadsheets.
- **Extensibility:** The modular design will allow for the future addition of new analysis capabilities and support for other file formats.

______________________________________________________________________

### **Technology Stack**

- **Programming Language: Python**
- **Rationale:** Python offers an unparalleled ecosystem of mature libraries for data analysis and Excel file manipulation (e.g., `openpyxl`, `pandas`, `xlrd`). Its widespread adoption in the data science and machine learning communities ensures a large talent pool and extensive support.
- **Primary Frameworks & Libraries:**
- **FastAPI:** For creating a high-performance, asynchronous API for file submission and report retrieval.
- **Celery & RabbitMQ:** To manage a distributed task queue for asynchronous processing of Excel files, enabling scalability and resilience.
- **Openpyxl & Pandas:** For the core deterministic parsing and data extraction from `.xlsx` and `.xls` files.
- **A Large Language Model (LLM):** A powerful model like Google's Gemini will be used for interpretative analysis.
- **Docker & Kubernetes:** For containerizing the application and orchestrating the various services, ensuring consistency across environments and enabling seamless scaling.
- **Data Storage:**
- **PostgreSQL:** To store metadata about each analysis job, user information, and structured analysis results.
- **S3-compatible Object Storage:** For securely storing the uploaded Excel files and the generated reports.

______________________________________________________________________

### **System Components & Data Flow**

The system is composed of several microservices, each with a distinct responsibility, communicating via a message queue.

*(A conceptual diagram would be placed here in a real document)*

**1. Ingestion & Validation Service (FastAPI)**

- **Function:** This is the user-facing entry point. It handles file uploads via a secure REST API.
- **Process:**
  1.  Receives the Excel file.
  2.  Assigns a unique job ID.
  3.  Performs initial validation: checks file integrity, size limits, and basic format correctness. Corrupted or empty files are flagged here.
  4.  Stores the file in a secure object storage bucket with the job ID as the key.
  5.  Publishes a new analysis task to the RabbitMQ message queue, containing the job ID and file location.
- **Key Consideration:** Implements strict security measures, including file type validation and scanning for known malware signatures.

**2. Orchestrator & Deterministic Analysis Core (Celery Worker)**

- **Function:** This is the workhorse of the system. It performs a deep, deterministic scan of the Excel file.
- **Process:**
  1.  Pulls an analysis task from the queue.
  2.  Downloads the file from object storage.
  3.  **Parses the file using `openpyxl` and `pandas` to extract:**
- **Workbook & Sheet Structure:** Names, visibility, and order of all sheets.
- **Cell-Level Data:** Values, data types, and exact coordinates (`A1` notation and row/column indices) of every cell containing data.
- **Formulas:** Extracts the raw formula string from each cell, identifying its location.
- **Named Ranges:** Catalogs all named ranges and their corresponding cell or range references.
- **Objects & Visualizations:** Identifies charts, images, pivot tables, and shapes, extracting their location, size, and associated data ranges.
- **Formatting & Validation:** Records conditional formatting rules, data validation criteria, and merged cell ranges.
- **Metadata:** Extracts file properties, author information, and other metadata.
- **External Links:** Lists all external references without attempting to resolve them.
  4.  This extracted, structured data is saved as a JSON object in the object storage.
  5.  Publishes a "Deterministic Analysis Complete" message to the queue, including the location of the structured data.

**3. LLM-Powered Insight Engine (Celery Worker with LLM Integration)**

- **Function:** This component uses the structured data from the deterministic analysis to generate higher-level insights.
- **Process:**
  1.  Pulls a task from the "Deterministic Analysis Complete" queue.
  2.  Loads the structured JSON data.
  3.  **Constructs a series of prompts for the LLM to analyze specific aspects:**
- **Sheet Role Analysis:** For each sheet, it sends the sheet name, a sample of its data, and the types of objects it contains to the LLM, asking it to infer the sheet's likely purpose (e.g., "Data Entry," "Dashboard," "Calculation Engine," "Reference Data").
- **Formula Analysis:** It provides the LLM with the extracted formulas and asks it to:
- Categorize them (e.g., financial, logical, lookup).
- Explain complex formulas in natural language.
- Identify dependencies between cells and sheets based on formula references.
- Flag potentially inefficient formulas (e.g., volatile functions like `INDIRECT` or entire column references).
- **Inconsistency & Error Detection:** The LLM is prompted to look for anomalies in the data, such as mixed data types in a column that seems to contain numerical data, or inconsistencies in formatting. It can also identify common Excel errors (`#N/A`, `#REF!`, etc.) and suggest potential causes.
- **Overall Summary:** The LLM generates a high-level executive summary of the workbook's structure, complexity, and key findings.
  4.  The insights from the LLM are then integrated into the structured JSON data.
  5.  Publishes a "Full Analysis Complete" message to the queue.

**4. Reporting & Output Service (Celery Worker)**

- **Function:** Generates user-friendly reports from the final, enriched data.
- **Process:**
  1.  Pulls a task from the "Full Analysis Complete" queue.
  2.  Loads the final JSON data.
  3.  **Generates multiple output formats:**
- **Interactive HTML Report:** A self-contained web page with collapsible sections, visualizations of sheet relationships, and interactive tables to explore the data.
- **PDF Summary:** A professional, printable report with key findings and visualizations.
- **Raw JSON:** The complete, structured data for programmatic use.
  4.  Saves the generated reports to the object storage.
  5.  Updates the job status in the PostgreSQL database to "Complete" with links to the reports.

______________________________________________________________________

### **Handling Key Challenges**

- **Variability in Files:** The deterministic parsing is designed to be robust. Large files will be processed asynchronously, so the user is not blocked. The system will time out on extremely large or complex files to prevent resource exhaustion, and this will be configurable. Protected elements will be flagged, noting that their contents cannot be analyzed.
- **Efficiency and Scalability:** The microservices architecture, combined with a message queue and container orchestration, allows for horizontal scaling. We can add more Celery workers to handle a higher volume of analyses in parallel.
- **Security:**
- **Sandboxing:** All file processing occurs in isolated containers.
- **No Code Execution:** Macros and embedded code are identified but never executed.
- **Data Encryption:** Data is encrypted at rest (in object storage and the database) and in transit.
- **Flexible Output:** Providing HTML, PDF, and JSON outputs caters to both human interpretation and machine integration. The interactive HTML report is key for usability.
- **Edge Cases:**
- **Empty/Corrupted Files:** Handled by the Ingestion & Validation Service. The job status is immediately set to "Failed" with a clear reason.
- **Extensibility:** The modular design makes it straightforward to add a new "Analysis Core" for other file types (e.g., Google Sheets, CSVs) without redesigning the entire system. A new "Parser" module could be developed and integrated into the workflow.

______________________________________________________________________

### **Assumptions and Limitations**

- **LLM Hallucinations:** While powerful, LLMs can make mistakes. The system mitigates this by grounding the LLM's analysis in the structured data from the deterministic parser. The output will clearly distinguish between deterministic facts and LLM-generated insights.
- **Encrypted Files:** Password-protected files cannot be analyzed unless the user provides the password at the time of upload (a potential future feature).
- **Macro Analysis:** The system will detect the presence of VBA macros but will not analyze their code for security reasons. A future extension could include a static analysis of VBA code in a highly secure sandbox.
- **Initial Cost:** The use of a powerful LLM will incur operational costs based on token usage. This will need to be factored into the business model.

This system design provides a robust and comprehensive solution to the client's challenge, balancing the need for precise, deterministic analysis with the power of LLMs for generating deep, actionable insights. Its modular and scalable nature ensures it can evolve with future demands.

### Proposed System Design: ExcelInsight - An Agentic AI-Powered Excel Analysis Platform

#### Introduction and Overview

I propose **ExcelInsight**, a scalable, secure, and extensible system for automated deep analysis of Excel files (.xlsx, .xls, and similar formats like Google Sheets exports). This tool will ingest an Excel file, dissect its structure and contents using a combination of deterministic parsing libraries and AI-driven agents, and output comprehensive insights in flexible formats (e.g., JSON reports, interactive HTML dashboards, PDFs, or API responses). The design leverages a multi-agent architecture inspired by frameworks like LangGraph and CrewAI, where specialized AI agents (powered by LLMs) collaborate to handle complex, context-aware analysis tasks. This hybrid approach ensures determinism for low-level parsing (e.g., extracting raw data) while using LLMs for higher-level inference (e.g., inferring sheet roles or detecting inefficiencies).

Key innovations:

- **Agentic Workflow**: A "crew" of specialized agents (e.g., Structure Agent, Formula Agent) coordinated by a Master Orchestrator Agent, allowing parallel processing and iterative refinement.
- **LLM Integration**: Agents use LLMs (e.g., via OpenAI API or open-source models like Llama 3) for natural language reasoning, such as classifying sheet functions or suggesting fixes, while avoiding execution of any file-embedded code.
- **Security-First Design**: Sandboxed execution, no external link following, and differential privacy techniques for sensitive data.
- **Extensibility**: Modular components for adding support for new file types (e.g., CSV or ODS) or analysis features.

This design draws inspiration from agentic tools like CrewAI (for crew-based collaboration) and LangGraph (for stateful, graph-based workflows), combined with Python's ecosystem for Excel handling. It addresses all client requirements, including variability, efficiency, and edge cases, while being future-proof for evolving LLM capabilities.

Assumptions:

- Access to an LLM API (e.g., GPT-4o or similar; open-source alternatives like Mistral can be self-hosted).
- Input files are provided via secure upload (no real-time web scraping).
- No need for real-time collaboration; batch processing is sufficient.
- Users have basic technical literacy for interpreting outputs.

Limitations:

- LLMs may introduce hallucinations in inferences (mitigated via grounding with deterministic data).
- Deep analysis of highly protected or corrupted files may be partial (e.g., password-protected sheets skipped with warnings).
- Performance on extremely large files (>1GB) may require cloud scaling.

#### High-Level Architecture

The system follows a modular, microservices-like architecture deployed as a containerized application (e.g., via Docker). It consists of:

- **Input Layer**: Handles file ingestion and validation.
- **Core Processing Layer**: Deterministic parsers + AI Agent Crew.
- **Output Layer**: Generates and formats reports/visualizations.
- **Orchestration Layer**: Manages workflows, state, and scaling.

Deployment Options:

- Standalone CLI tool for developers.
- Web API (e.g., FastAPI) for integration.
- Cloud-hosted (e.g., AWS Lambda for scalability).

Tech Stack Rationale:

- **Language**: Python 3.12+ – Ubiquitous, excellent libraries for Excel (openpyxl, pandas, xlrd), and seamless LLM integration.
- **Excel Parsing Libraries**:
- openpyxl (primary for .xlsx: reads formulas, charts, pivot tables, metadata without execution).
- xlrd (for legacy .xls support).
- pandas (for data manipulation and analysis).
- Rationale: Based on research, openpyxl is best for structural analysis (e.g., formulas, charts); pandas excels at data insights. No execution of VBA/macros to avoid security risks.
- **Agentic Framework**: LangGraph (for graph-based, stateful multi-agent flows) + CrewAI elements (for role-based agents). Rationale: LangGraph's low latency and modularity suit complex workflows; it's open-source and LLM-agnostic.
- **LLM Backend**: OpenAI GPT-4o or Hugging Face Transformers for local models. Rationale: Balances accuracy with cost; supports prompting for grounded reasoning.
- **Other Frameworks**: FastAPI (API layer), Celery (task queuing for parallelism), Plotly/Dash (visualizations), ReportLab (PDF reports).
- **Security**: PyArmor for code obfuscation, sandboxing via Docker, and no dynamic code execution.

#### Key Components

1. **File Ingestion Module**:

- Validates input (e.g., file type, size \<500MB default limit, integrity check via hashlib).
- Handles edge cases: Empty files (return basic report), corrupted files (attempt partial parse with errors flagged).
- Converts Google Sheets exports to .xlsx if needed (via simple metadata mapping).
- Output: Raw workbook object (e.g., openpyxl.load_workbook()).

2. **Deterministic Parser Engine**:

- Extracts raw data structures without AI.
- Features:
- Map cell locations, values, formats (e.g., merged cells, conditional formatting via openpyxl.iter_rows()).
- Catalog formulas (parse with openpyxl, categorize as arithmetic/logical/array).
- Detect graphical elements (charts via openpyxl.chart, images/shapes via worksheet.\_images).
- Identify pivot tables (via openpyxl.pivot), named ranges, data validations, filters, hyperlinks, comments, metadata (via workbook.properties).
- Note external links (e.g., via worksheet.external_links) without following.
- Scan for embedded items (e.g., OLE objects) and flag potential issues (e.g., #REF! errors).
- Rationale: Ensures accuracy and efficiency for factual extraction; feeds into agents as grounded context.

3. **AI Agent Crew (Core Analysis Layer)**:

- Built on LangGraph: Agents as nodes in a directed graph, with edges for data flows and conditional branching (e.g., if formulas detected, route to Formula Agent).
- Coordinated by **Master Orchestrator Agent** (LLM-powered): Plans tasks, assigns to specialists, aggregates results, and iterates if inconsistencies found.
- Specialized Agents (each with role-specific prompts and tools):
- **Structure Agent**: Analyzes sheet layouts, maps content elements with coordinates (e.g., "Cell A1: Header 'Sales'"). Infers sheet roles (e.g., "Data storage" via LLM classification based on content density).
- **Dependency Agent**: Identifies relationships (e.g., cross-sheet references via formula parsing + graph traversal). Builds dependency graphs (using networkx).
- **Formula Agent**: Catalogs formulas, traces dependencies/impacts (e.g., "Formula in B2 depends on Sheet2!A1"). Detects inefficiencies (e.g., volatile functions like INDIRECT()).
- **Visualization Agent**: Describes charts/graphs (e.g., "Bar chart sourcing from range A1:B10, title 'Revenue'"). Analyzes configurations and data sources.
- **Feature Agent**: Handles pivot tables (e.g., summarize fields/filters), conditional formatting, validations, etc.
- **Issue Detection Agent**: Scans for errors (e.g., circular references), inconsistencies (e.g., data type mismatches), vulnerabilities (e.g., hidden sheets with sensitive data), inefficiencies (e.g., redundant formulas). Suggests fixes (e.g., "Replace VLOOKUP with INDEX/MATCH for performance").
- Each agent uses LLM prompting with grounded context (e.g., "Based on this extracted formula: {formula}, classify its type and suggest optimizations.").
- Tools for Agents: Custom functions (e.g., query parser engine) + built-in LangGraph tools for parallelism.
- Rationale: Agentic design allows creative, context-aware analysis (e.g., LLM infers "visualization sheet" from chart density). Inspired by AutoGen's multi-agent collaboration for handling complexity.

4. **Output Generator**:

- Compiles agent outputs into structured formats:
- JSON/XML for integration.
- HTML Dashboard (Dash/Plotly: interactive dependency graphs, heatmaps for issues).
- PDF Report (ReportLab: summarized insights with visuals).
- Visualizations: E.g., sheet dependency graphs, formula trees.
- Customizable (e.g., verbosity levels, focus areas via user flags).

5. **Monitoring and Scaling Module**:

- Logs agent decisions and LLM prompts for auditability.
- Uses Celery for task queuing (parallel agent execution).
- Auto-scales via Kubernetes for large files (e.g., split sheets across workers).

#### Data Flows

1. **Ingestion**: User uploads file → Validation → Parser Engine extracts raw data (e.g., JSON dump of workbook structure).
1. **Orchestration**: Master Agent receives raw data → Plans graph (e.g., "Parallel: Structure + Feature Agents → Sequential: Dependency → Issue").
1. **Analysis Loop**:

- Agents process in parallel/sequence, querying parser as needed.
- State shared via LangGraph (e.g., Dependency Agent uses Structure Agent's output).
- Iteration: If Issue Agent flags ambiguity, loop back to relevant agent.

4. **Aggregation**: Master Agent synthesizes results (e.g., LLM prompt: "Summarize findings from all agents").
1. **Output**: Generate reports → Deliver to user (e.g., download link).

Example Flow for a File:

- Parse: Extract sheets, formulas.
- Agents: Structure infers roles; Dependency builds graph; Issue detects errors.
- Output: JSON with mapped elements + suggestions.

#### Key Decisions and Rationale

- **Hybrid Deterministic + LLM Approach**: Deterministic for reliability (e.g., exact cell mapping); LLMs for intelligence (e.g., role inference). Rationale: Avoids LLM hallucinations by grounding prompts with parsed data; inspired by agentic tools like Devin for code analysis.
- **Multi-Agent vs. Monolithic**: Enables parallelism (e.g., analyze sheets concurrently) and modularity (easy to add agents for new features). Rationale: Handles complexity scalably; draws from CrewAI's crew model.
- **No Code Execution**: Parse formulas as strings; flag macros without running. Rationale: Security priority; prevents malware risks.
- **Efficiency/Scalability**: In-memory parsing for small files; chunked processing for large ones (e.g., sheet-by-sheet). Rationale: Addresses variability; cloud scaling for resource-heavy tasks.
- **Security Measures**: Sandbox all operations; anonymize sensitive data in LLM prompts (e.g., replace values with placeholders). Rationale: Handles sensitive files safely.
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system for new parsers (e.g., add LibreOffice API for ODS) or agents (e.g., for Power BI integration). Rationale: Future-proofing.
- **Edge Cases**: Handled via try-except in parser (e.g., corrupted files: "Partial analysis only"); agents prompted to note uncertainties.

This design provides a robust, innovative solution that meets the client's needs while being practical to implement. Estimated development time: 4-6 weeks for MVP with a small team. If needed, I can provide pseudocode or a prototype sketch.
