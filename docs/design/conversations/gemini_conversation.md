# Conversation with Gemini

This document contains a conversation about designing a comprehensive Excel file analysis system using AI and deterministic tooling approaches.

## User Query

You are an innovative system architect with over 15 years of experience designing scalable, secure, and efficient software systems for data-intensive applications. You specialize in creating tools that handle complex file formats, perform deep analysis, and integrate advanced computational capabilities, always prioritizing usability, performance, and extensibility. You approach problems methodically, considering trade-offs, edge cases, and future-proofing without assuming any specific technologies or frameworks upfront.

A client has approached you with the following challenge: They need a comprehensive system for analyzing Excel files (.xlsx, .xls, and potentially similar formats like Google Sheets exports). The goal is to build a powerful tool that can automatically dissect any Excel file, providing deep insights into its structure, contents, and potential issues, suitable for users like data analysts, auditors, developers, or business professionals who want to understand files without manual effort.

The system should process an input Excel file and generate a detailed output (e.g., reports, visualizations, or structured data) that reveals the file's inner workings. Key aspects to address include:

- Mapping the exact locations of all content elements, such as cells, ranges, and objects, with precise coordinates and contextual details.
- Analyzing each sheet's role or function (e.g., data storage, computation, visualization, or reference).
- Identifying relationships and dependencies between sheets, like data flows or cross-references.
- Cataloging formulas, including their types, dependencies, and impacts.
- Detecting and describing graphical elements like charts, graphs, images, or shapes, along with their configurations and data sources.
- Covering all other internal features, such as pivot tables, named ranges, conditional formatting, data validations, filters, merged cells, hyperlinks, comments, metadata, and embedded items (without executing any code).
- Noting external links or references without following them.
- Detecting issues like errors, inconsistencies, vulnerabilities, or inefficiencies, and suggesting possible fixes or improvements where appropriate.

Additionally, consider:

- Variability in file sizes, complexities, and conditions (e.g., large files, messy structures, protected elements).
- Efficiency and scalability for resource-heavy analyses.
- Security to handle sensitive data and avoid risks from malicious content.
- Flexible output formats for easy interpretation and integration.
- Edge cases, such as empty or corrupted files, and potential for extensibility to other file types.

We are open to solutions that make use of LLMs combined with deterministic tooling. There are many agentic architectures for LLMs; feel free to leverage existing ones or come up with your own. There are also open source agentic coding solutions (such as Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, SWE Agent, Aider, Devin, Claude Code, and many more) from which you can draw inspiration in terms of workflows and architectures. Choose the best programming language to implement it in, along with any frameworks or other parameters as you see fit.

Propose a complete system design to solve this problem. Outline the architecture, components, data flows, and any key decisions, explaining your rationale and noting assumptions or limitations. Be creative and thorough in your solution.

## Gemini Response

Of course. Here is a comprehensive system design for the Excel analysis tool.

### **System Architecture: "ExcelQuant"**

## **ExcelQuant** is a modular, scalable, and secure system designed for the deep analysis of spreadsheet files. It employs a hybrid architecture, combining deterministic parsing for structural accuracy with Large Language Models (LLMs) for nuanced, human-like interpretation and insight generation. The system is designed to be a cloud-native, containerized application, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

### **Core Principles**

- **Accuracy First:** Deterministic tools will form the bedrock of the analysis, ensuring factual correctness for elements like cell values, formulas, and object locations.
- **Insightful Interpretation:** LLMs will be used to analyze less structured data, such as the purpose of a sheet, the complexity of formulas, and potential inconsistencies.
- **Security by Design:** All components will operate within a secure, sandboxed environment to handle sensitive data and mitigate risks from potentially malicious files.
- **Scalability and Performance:** The architecture will support asynchronous processing and be horizontally scalable to handle varying workloads, from small files to massive, complex spreadsheets.
- **Extensibility:** The modular design will allow for the future addition of new analysis capabilities and support for other file formats.

______________________________________________________________________

### **Technology Stack**

- **Programming Language: Python**
  - **Rationale:** Python offers an unparalleled ecosystem of mature libraries for data analysis and Excel file manipulation (e.g., `openpyxl`, `pandas`, `xlrd`). Its widespread adoption in the data science and machine learning communities ensures a large talent pool and extensive support.
- **Primary Frameworks & Libraries:**
  - **FastAPI:** For creating a high-performance, asynchronous API for file submission and report retrieval.
  - **Celery & RabbitMQ:** To manage a distributed task queue for asynchronous processing of Excel files, enabling scalability and resilience.
  - **Openpyxl & Pandas:** For the core deterministic parsing and data extraction from `.xlsx` and `.xls` files.
  - **A Large Language Model (LLM):** A powerful model like Google's Gemini will be used for interpretative analysis.
  - **Docker & Kubernetes:** For containerizing the application and orchestrating the various services, ensuring consistency across environments and enabling seamless scaling.
- **Data Storage:**
  - **PostgreSQL:** To store metadata about each analysis job, user information, and structured analysis results.
  - **S3-compatible Object Storage:** For securely storing the uploaded Excel files and the generated reports.

______________________________________________________________________

### **System Components & Data Flow**

The system is composed of several microservices, each with a distinct responsibility, communicating via a message queue.
*(A conceptual diagram would be placed here in a real document)*
**1. Ingestion & Validation Service (FastAPI)**

- **Function:** This is the user-facing entry point. It handles file uploads via a secure REST API.
- **Process:**
  1. Receives the Excel file.
  1. Assigns a unique job ID.
  1. Performs initial validation: checks file integrity, size limits, and basic format correctness. Corrupted or empty files are flagged here.
  1. Stores the file in a secure object storage bucket with the job ID as the key.
  1. Publishes a new analysis task to the RabbitMQ message queue, containing the job ID and file location.
- **Key Consideration:** Implements strict security measures, including file type validation and scanning for known malware signatures.
  **2. Orchestrator & Deterministic Analysis Core (Celery Worker)**
- **Function:** This is the workhorse of the system. It performs a deep, deterministic scan of the Excel file.
- **Process:**
  1. Pulls an analysis task from the queue.
  1. Downloads the file from object storage.
  1. **Parses the file using `openpyxl` and `pandas` to extract:**
     - **Workbook & Sheet Structure:** Names, visibility, and order of all sheets.
     - **Cell-Level Data:** Values, data types, and exact coordinates (`A1` notation and row/column indices) of every cell containing data.
     - **Formulas:** Extracts the raw formula string from each cell, identifying its location.
     - **Named Ranges:** Catalogs all named ranges and their corresponding cell or range references.
     - **Objects & Visualizations:** Identifies charts, images, pivot tables, and shapes, extracting their location, size, and associated data ranges.
     - **Formatting & Validation:** Records conditional formatting rules, data validation criteria, and merged cell ranges.
     - **Metadata:** Extracts file properties, author information, and other metadata.
     - **External Links:** Lists all external references without attempting to resolve them.
  1. This extracted, structured data is saved as a JSON object in the object storage.
  1. Publishes a "Deterministic Analysis Complete" message to the queue, including the location of the structured data.
     **3. LLM-Powered Insight Engine (Celery Worker with LLM Integration)**
- **Function:** This component uses the structured data from the deterministic analysis to generate higher-level insights.
- **Process:**
  1. Pulls a task from the "Deterministic Analysis Complete" queue.
  1. Loads the structured JSON data.
  1. **Constructs a series of prompts for the LLM to analyze specific aspects:**
     - **Sheet Role Analysis:** For each sheet, it sends the sheet name, a sample of its data, and the types of objects it contains to the LLM, asking it to infer the sheet's likely purpose (e.g., "Data Entry," "Dashboard," "Calculation Engine," "Reference Data").
     - **Formula Analysis:** It provides the LLM with the extracted formulas and asks it to:
       - Categorize them (e.g., financial, logical, lookup).
       - Explain complex formulas in natural language.
       - Identify dependencies between cells and sheets based on formula references.
       - Flag potentially inefficient formulas (e.g., volatile functions like `INDIRECT` or entire column references).
     - **Inconsistency & Error Detection:** The LLM is prompted to look for anomalies in the data, such as mixed data types in a column that seems to contain numerical data, or inconsistencies in formatting. It can also identify common Excel errors (`#N/A`, `#REF!`, etc.) and suggest potential causes.
     - **Overall Summary:** The LLM generates a high-level executive summary of the workbook's structure, complexity, and key findings.
  1. The insights from the LLM are then integrated into the structured JSON data.
  1. Publishes a "Full Analysis Complete" message to the queue.
     **4. Reporting & Output Service (Celery Worker)**
- **Function:** Generates user-friendly reports from the final, enriched data.
- **Process:**
  1. Pulls a task from the "Full Analysis Complete" queue.
  1. Loads the final JSON data.
  1. **Generates multiple output formats:**
     - **Interactive HTML Report:** A self-contained web page with collapsible sections, visualizations of sheet relationships, and interactive tables to explore the data.
     - **PDF Summary:** A professional, printable report with key findings and visualizations.
     - **Raw JSON:** The complete, structured data for programmatic use.
  1. Saves the generated reports to the object storage.
  1. Updates the job status in the PostgreSQL database to "Complete" with links to the reports.

______________________________________________________________________

### **Handling Key Challenges**

- **Variability in Files:** The deterministic parsing is designed to be robust. Large files will be processed asynchronously, so the user is not blocked. The system will time out on extremely large or complex files to prevent resource exhaustion, and this will be configurable. Protected elements will be flagged, noting that their contents cannot be analyzed.
- **Efficiency and Scalability:** The microservices architecture, combined with a message queue and container orchestration, allows for horizontal scaling. We can add more Celery workers to handle a higher volume of analyses in parallel.
- **Security:**
  - **Sandboxing:** All file processing occurs in isolated containers.
  - **No Code Execution:** Macros and embedded code are identified but never executed.
  - **Data Encryption:** Data is encrypted at rest (in object storage and the database) and in transit.
- **Flexible Output:** Providing HTML, PDF, and JSON outputs caters to both human interpretation and machine integration. The interactive HTML report is key for usability.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Empty/Corrupted Files:** Handled by the Ingestion & Validation Service. The job status is immediately set to "Failed" with a clear reason.
  - **Extensibility:** The modular design makes it straightforward to add a new "Analysis Core" for other file types (e.g., Google Sheets, CSVs) without redesigning the entire system. A new "Parser" module could be developed and integrated into the workflow.

______________________________________________________________________

### **Assumptions and Limitations**

- **LLM Hallucinations:** While powerful, LLMs can make mistakes. The system mitigates this by grounding the LLM's analysis in the structured data from the deterministic parser. The output will clearly distinguish between deterministic facts and LLM-generated insights.
- **Encrypted Files:** Password-protected files cannot be analyzed unless the user provides the password at the time of upload (a potential future feature).
- **Macro Analysis:** The system will detect the presence of VBA macros but will not analyze their code for security reasons. A future extension could include a static analysis of VBA code in a highly secure sandbox.
- **Initial Cost:** The use of a powerful LLM will incur operational costs based on token usage. This will need to be factored into the business model.
  This system design provides a robust and comprehensive solution to the client's challenge, balancing the need for precise, deterministic analysis with the power of LLMs for generating deep, actionable insights. Its modular and scalable nature ensures it can evolve with future demands.
  here are more resources that may help in your decision making:
  https://blog/context-engineeri you're envisioni scan the surface, then a tightly-governed LLM layer writes code, walks ranges, and publishes facts. The design borrows proven ideas from frameworks such as LangGraph and AutoGen, plus lessons from the current **fileintel-prototype** (e.g., Stage-1 filename/MIME hints, FileCard schema, Agent Tool Bus).

## Key takeaway (summary)

Explorers should stay deterministic---hashing, format sniffing, security checks---while **specialised LLM agents run in a sandboxed, auditable Tool Bus** that lets them: (1) call a rich library of *read\\\_* functions (e.g., `read_sheet_range`, `read_pdf_page`), (2) incrementally summarise chunks so context never explodes, (3) auto-generate & test extraction code (Python/SQL) against built-in validators, and (4) stream verified facts into FileCards and PersonaGraph. Guard-rails (rate limits, policy checks) keep autonomy safe and costs bounded. The gaps today are mostly orchestration, memory management, and specific range utilities---solvable with existing open-source pieces and a few internal services.
\---

## 1 Who does what?

| Layer | Scope | Deterministic? | AI? | Notes |
| \------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stage-0 → 2 Explorers** | hash, MIME, provider hints, macro flags | ✅ | ❌ | Already implemented in prototype; filename/MIME heuristics feed confidence scores |
| **Structural Parsers** | enumerate sheets, tables, ranges, pages | ✅ | ❌ | Use openpyxl, pdfplumber, Tika etc. |
| **LLM Agents (Stage-4+)** | classification, code generation, fact extraction | ⚠️ | ✅ | Run via Tool Bus with guard-rails & policy layer |
| **FileCard Builder** | merge raw text, AI summaries, key facts | Mixed | Mixed | See FileCard entity spec |

### Why keep explorers deterministic?

- Early exits save tokens: a large duplicate PDF is skipped long before any LLM runs.
- Security: VBA or App Script detected → route to sandbox rather than ChatGPT.

## 2 LLM sandbox & Tool Bus

- **Code Interpreter**: expose a *local* Python sandbox modelled on OpenAI's Code Interpreter (runs 30 s, 512 MB RAM, no network).
- **Tool Registry**: every callable (`read_sheet_range`, `list_sheets`, `write_fact`) is described in JSON Schema; LangGraph's guarded-edge pattern lets you add human-in-the-loop moderation if autonomy > N%.
- **Multi-Agent Patterns**: borrow AutoGen's "planner+worker+critic" loop so one agent writes code, another evaluates output, a third decides if more context is needed. This matches ADR-022's vision of a secure, auditable Tool Bus .

## 3 Range-based reading & summarisation

1\. **Read utilities**

- `read_sheet_range(sheet_id, "A1:F500")` → pandas DF (openpyxl pattern)
- `read_pdf_page(file_id, 3)` → text & bbox.
- These wrappers hide library quirks and emit *ExtractionUnit* objects with lineage coordinates.
  2\. **Hierarchical chunking**
- Explorers tag logical units (sheet, table, paragraph).
- Agents use *recursive/hierarchical chunking* so they never exceed context: see LongRefiner (2025) and typical RAG chunking guides.
  3\. **Streaming summariser**
- After each chunk parse, agent sends a *summary-patch* to a token-limited scratchpad (map-reduce / "collapse" pattern).
- This running précis plus FileCard history provides memory.

## 4 Auto-generated extractors

- **CodeGenerator service** (design already sketched in prototype) .
- Flow: LLM writes code → validator runs unit tests → if pass, tool is packaged and versioned.
- Compile-once-run-many amortises cost for repetitive forms (e.g., one bank CSV template).

## 5 Memory & knowledge graph updates

- When agent closes a FileCard, it emits **FinancialFact** nodes; Tool Bus moderates and commits to PersonaGraph.
- Deduplication/confidence logic already outlined in Chronicle update function .

## 6 Safety, cost & governance

- **Budget Enforcement**: per-agent token + CPU budgets enforced by Tool Bus (rate-limit config in ADR-022) .
- **Sandbox**: no network, no file system outside `/sandbox`, path traversal rules etc. (see prototype security list) .
- **Explain-ability**: every fact stores source range/page offset so auditors can replay extraction.

## 7 Gaps & improvements

| Gap | Proposal | Rationale |
| \----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Spreadsheet macro risk** | Auto-flag `.xlsx` & run `olevba` offline before LLM | Prevent prompt/macro injection. |
| **Google Sheets Apps Script** | Use Drive API to list bound scripts, raise Trust Tier | LLM can decide to ignore or inspect. |
| **Vector feedback loop** | Embed failed extraction cases and retrain few-shot prompts nightly | Reduces hallucination, increases recall. |
| **Performance metrics** | Log per-agent wall time & tokens, feed cost dashboard | Supports budget governance. |
| **Synthetic test corpus** | Generate red-team docs (zip bombs, misleading headers) for CI | Keeps pipeline robust. |
\---

## 8 Roadmap snapshot

1\. **Week 1-2** Ship range-reader tools (`read_sheet_range`, `read_pdf_page`).
2\. **Week 3-4** Integrate Code Interpreter sandbox & Tool Bus policies.
3\. **Week 5** Roll out planner/worker/critic AutoGen loop for complex docs.
4\. **Week 6+** Continuous evaluation set; cost KPIs; human-in-the-loop UI.
\---

### Bottom line

Your instinct is correct: deterministic explorers alone aren't enough; but giving an LLM raw files without structure is wasteful. A **two-layer design---"structured explorers + sandboxed agent coders"**---delivers precision, safety, and scalability. Most building blocks already exist in your prototype and in the open-source ecosystem; the main work is stitching them together under a governed Tool Bus and enriching them with smart range utilities and hierarchical summarisation. Implement these pieces, and you unlock fully autonomous, auditable extraction with predictable cost.

## Extensibility Considerations

The architecture supports future extensions:
1\. **Additional File Formats**:
\- Plugin-based parser system
\- Standardized internal representation
\- For of specialized agents (e.g., Structure Agent, Formula Agent) coordinated by a Master Orchestrator Agent, allowing parallel processing and iterative refinement.
\- **LLM Integration**: Agents use LLMs (e.g., via OpenAI API or open-source models like Llama 3) for natural language reasoning, such as classifying sheet functions or suggesting fixes, while avoiding execution of any file-embedded code.
\- **Security-First Design**: Sandboxed execution, no external link following, and differential privacy techniques for sensitive data.
\- **Extensibility**: Modular components for adding support for new file types (e.g., CSV or ODS) or analysis features.
This design draws inspiration from agentic tools like CrewAI (for crew-based collaboration) and LangGraph (for stateful, graph-based workflows), combined with Python's ecosystem for Excel handling. It addresses all client requirements, including variability, efficiency, and edge cases, while being future-proof for evolving LLM capabilities.
Assumptions:
\- Access to an LLM API (e.g., GPT-4o or similar; open-source alternatives like Mistral can be self-hosted).
\- Input files are provided via secure upload (no real-time web scraping).
\- No need for real-time collaboration; batch processing is sufficient.
\- Users have basic technical literacy for interpreting outputs.
Limitations:
\- LLMs may introduce hallucinations in inferences (mitigated via grounding with deterministic data).
\- Deep analysis of highly protected or corrupted files may be partial (e.g., password-protected sheets skipped with warnings).
\- Performance on extremely large files (>1GB) may require cloud scaling.

#### High-Level Architecture

The system follows a modular, microservices-like architecture deployed as a containerized application (e.g., via Docker). It consists of:
\- **Input Layer**: Handles file ingestion and validation.
\- **Core Processing Layer**: Deterministic parsers + AI Agent Crew.
\- **Output Layer**: Generates and formats reports/visualizations.
\- **Orchestration Layer**: Manages workflows, state, and scaling.
Deployment Options:
\- Standalone CLI tool for developers.
\- Web API (e.g., FastAPI) for integration.
\- Cloud-hosted (e.g., AWS Lambda for scalability).
Tech Stack Rationale:
\- **Language**: Python 3.12+ -- Ubiquitous, excellent libraries for Excel (openpyxl, pandas, xlrd), and seamless LLM integration.
\- **Excel Parsing Libraries**:
\- openpyxl (primary for : reads formulas, charts, pivot tables, metadata without execution).
\- xlrd (for legacy support).
\- pandas (for data manipulation and analysis).
\- Rationale: Based on research, openpyxl is best for structural analysis (e.g., formulas, charts); pandas excels at data insights. No execution of VBA/macros to avoid security risks.
\- **Agentic Framework**: LangGraph (for graph-based, stateful multi-agent flows) + CrewAI elements (for role-based agents). Rationale: LangGraph's low latency and modularity suit complex workflows; it's open-source and LLM-agnostic.
\- **LLM Backend**: OpenAI GPT-4o or Hugging Face Transformers for local models. Rationale: Balances accuracy with cost; supports prompting for grounded reasoning.
\- **Other Frameworks**: FastAPI (API layer), Celery (task queuing for parallelism), Plotly/Dash (visualizations), ReportLab (PDF reports).
\- **Security**: PyArmor for code obfuscation, sandboxing via Docker, and no dynamic code execution.

#### Key Components

1\. **File Ingestion Module**:
\- Validates input (e.g., file type, size \<500MB default limit, integrity check via hashlib).
\- Handles edge cases: Empty files (return basic report), corrupted files (attempt partial parse with errors flagged).
\- Converts Google Sheets exports to if needed (via simple metadata mapping).
\- Output: Raw workbook object (e.g., openpyxl()).
2\. **Deterministic Parser Engine**:
\- Extracts raw data structures without AI.
\- Features:
\- Map cell locations, values, formats (e.g., merged cells, conditional formatting via openpyxl()).
\- Catalog formulas (parse with openpyxl, categorize as arithmetic/logical/array).
\- Detect graphical elements (charts via openpyxl, images/shapes via worksheet.\_images).
\- Identify pivot tables (via openpyxl), named ranges, data validations, filters, hyperlinks, comments, metadata (via workbook).
\- Note external links (e.g., via worksheet) without following.
\- Scan for embedded items (e.g., OLE objects) and flag potential issues (e.g., #REF! errors).
\- Rationale: Ensures accuracy and efficiency for factual extraction; feeds into agents as grounded context.
3\. **AI Agent Crew (Core Analysis Layer)**:
\- Built on LangGraph: Agents as nodes in a directed graph, with edges for data flows and conditional branching (e.g., if formulas detected, route to Formula Agent).
\- Coordinated by **Master Orchestrator Agent** (LLM-powered): Plans tasks, assigns to specialists, aggregates results, and iterates if inconsistencies found.
\- Specialized Agents (each with role-specific prompts and tools):
\- **Structure Agent**: Analyzes sheet layouts, maps content elements with coordinates (e.g., "Cell A1: Header 'Sales'"). Infers sheet roles (e.g., "Data storage" via LLM classification based on content density).
\- **Dependency Agent**: Identifies relationships (e.g., cross-sheet references via formula parsing + graph traversal). Builds dependency graphs (using networkx).
\- **Formula Agent**: Catalogs formulas, traces dependencies/impacts (e.g., "Formula in B2 depends on Sheet2!A1"). Detects inefficiencies (e.g., volatile functions like INDIRECT()).
\- **Visualization Agent**: Describes charts/graphs (e.g., "Bar chart sourcing from range A1:B10, title 'Revenue'"). Analyzes configurations and data sources.
\- **Feature Agent**: Handles pivot tables (e.g., summarize fields/filters), conditional formatting, validations, etc.
\- **Issue Detection Agent**: Scans for errors (e.g., circular references), inconsistencies (e.g., data type mismatches), vulnerabilities (e.g., hidden sheets with sensitive data), inefficiencies (e.g., redundant formulas). Suggests fixes (e.g., "Replace VLOOKUP with INDEX/MATCH for performance").
\- Each agent uses LLM prompting with grounded context (e.g., "Based on this extracted formula: , classify its type and suggest optimizations.").
\- Tools for Agents: Custom functions (e.g., query parser engine) + built-in LangGraph tools for parallelism.
\- Rationale: Agentic design allows creative, context-aware analysis (e.g., LLM infers "visualization sheet" from chart density). Inspired by AutoGen's multi-agent collaboration for handling complexity.
4\. **Output Generator**:
\- Compiles agent outputs into structured formats:
\- JSON/XML for integration.
\- HTML Dashboard (Dash/Plotly: interactive dependency graphs, heatmaps for issues).
\- PDF Report (ReportLab: summarized insights with visuals).
\- Visualizations: E., sheet dependency graphs, formula trees.
\- Customizable (e.g., verbosity levels, focus areas via user flags).
5\. **Monitoring and Scaling Module**:
\- Logs agent decisions and LLM prompts for auditability.
\- Uses Celery for task queuing (parallel agent execution).
\- Auto-scales via Kubernetes for large files (e.g., split sheets across workers).

#### Data Flows

1\. **Ingestion**: User uploads file → Validation → Parser Engine extracts raw data (e.g., JSON dump of workbook structure).
2\. **Orchestration**: Master Agent receives raw data → Plans graph (e.g., "Parallel: Structure + Feature Agents → Sequential: Dependency → Issue").
3\. **Analysis Loop**:
\- Agents process in parallel/sequence, querying parser as needed.
\- State shared via LangGraph (e.g., Dependency Agent uses Structure Agent's output).
\- Iteration: If Issue Agent flags ambiguity, loop back to relevant agent.
4\. **Aggregation**: Master Agent synthesizes results (e.g., LLM prompt: "Summarize findings from all agents").
5\. **Output**: Generate reports → Deliver to user (e.g., download link).
Example Flow for a File:
\- Parse: Extract sheets, formulas.
\- Agents: Structure infers roles; Dependency builds graph; Issue detects errors.
\- Output: JSON with mapped elements + suggestions.

#### Key Decisions and Rationale

## - **Hybrid Deterministic + LLM Approach**: Deterministic for reliability (e.g., exact cell mapping); LLMs for intelligence (e.g., role inference). Rationale: Avoids LLM hallucinations by grounding prompts with parsed data; inspired by agentic tools like Devin for code analysis. - **Multi-Agent vs. Monolithic**: Enables parallelism (e.g., analyze sheets concurrently) and modularity (easy to add agents for new features). Rationale: Handles complexity scalably; draws from CrewAI's crew model. - **No Code Execution**: Parse formulas as strings; flag macros without running. Rationale: Security priority; prevents malware risks. - **Efficiency/Scalability**: In-memory parsing for small files; chunked processing for large ones (e.g., sheet-by-sheet). Rationale: Addresses variability; cloud scaling for resource-heavy tasks. - **Security Measures**: Sandbox all operations; anonymize sensitive data in LLM prompts (e.g., replace values with placeholders). Rationale: Handles sensitive files safely. - **Extensibility**: Plugin system for new parsers (e.g., add LibreOffice API for ODS) or agents (e.g., for Power BI integration). Rationale: Future-proofing. - **Edge Cases**: Handled via try-except in parser (e.g., corrupted files: "Partial analysis only"); agents prompted to note uncertainties. This design provides a robust, innovative solution that meets the client's needs while being practical to implement. Estimated development time: 4-6 weeks for MVP with a small team. If needed, I can provide pseudocode or a prototype sketch.\`.xlsx\`\` [Show thinking] Thank you for providing these excellent resources and detailed design proposals. They offer a strong foundation and align with best practices in modern agentic systems. After reviewing them, I've synthesized the strongest concepts from each into a unified, comprehensive system architecture. This proposed design, which we'll call **"Excel Aegis,"** prioritizes a layered intelligence approach, robust security, and scalable performance by merging the best of deterministic tooling and governed AI agency.

### **System Architecture: Excel Aegis**

**Excel Aegis** is a hybrid intelligence platform designed to dissect spreadsheet files with high precision and deep contextual understanding. It operates on a core principle: **deterministic explorers establish ground truth, while specialized AI agents, operating within a secure, governed environment, derive insights.**
This architecture integrates the "Tool Bus" concept from the blueprint, the clear microservice flow of "ExcelQuant," the high-performance stack from the third design, and the collaborative agentic workflow of "ExcelInsight."

### **Technology Stack**

- **Primary Language (AI Core):** **Python** for its rich data science ecosystem (`openpyxl`, `pandas`, `LangGraph`, `RAPIDS cuDF`).
- **High-Performance Services:** **Go** for the Ingestion and Triage services, where concurrency and low-latency I/O are critical.
- **Agentic Framework:** **LangGraph** to create a stateful, graph-based workflow for the AI agent crew, allowing for complex, conditional analysis paths.
- **Parsing & Security:**
  - **`openpyxl`** for `.xlsx` structure, formulas, and metadata.
  - **`xlrd`** for legacy `.xlsx` files.
  - **`olevba`** for static VBA macro analysis during the triage stage.
- **Infrastructure:**
  - **Kubernetes** for container orchestration.
  - **Kafka** as the high-throughput message bus for inter-service communication.
  - **gVisor** as the runtime class for sandboxing the analysis pods, providing kernel-level isolation.
  - **PostgreSQL** for metadata and job tracking; **Redis** for caching.

______________________________________________________________________

### **Detailed Processing Stages**

#### **Stage 1: Ingestion**

- **Function:** A high-concurrency service (written in **Go**) handles file uploads via a secure API.
- **Process:**
  1. Receives the file, assigns a unique Job ID.
  1. Performs initial validation: MIME type, file extension, size limits.
  1. Sanitizes the filename.
  1. Stores the raw file in an S3-compatible object store.
  1. Publishes a `FileReceived` event to a Kafka topic with the job ID and file location.

#### **Stage 2: Triage & Preparation**

- **Function:** This security-focused stage prepares the file for deep analysis.
- **Process:**
  1. Consumes the `FileReceived` event.
  1. **Security Scan:** Runs the file through a sandboxed `olevba` scan to detect the presence and potential risk of macros. **No code is executed.**
  1. **Structural Pre-Parsing:** A deterministic parser enumerates core components (sheets, named ranges, pivot table locations) to create a "structural map." This is a quick, low-level scan.
  1. **Triage Decision:** Based on the security scan and structural complexity, a "risk profile" and "analysis plan" are generated. For example, a file with macros (`.xlsx`) is flagged, ensuring it runs in the most secure sandbox.
  1. Publishes a `FileReadyForAnalysis` event containing the structural map and risk profile.

#### **Stage 3: Agentic Analysis (The Core)**

This is where the deep analysis occurs, using a multi-agent "crew" orchestrated by LangGraph. The entire process runs inside a **gVisor-sandboxed Kubernetes pod** with strict resource limits and no network access.

- **The Orchestrator Agent:**
  - Consumes the `FileReadyForAnalysis` event.
  - Acts as the "planner," reading the structural map and analysis plan.
  - Constructs and executes a dynamic analysis graph using specialized agents as nodes.
- **The Agent Crew & Tool Bus:** Each agent is a specialized LLM-powered worker with access to a limited set of secure, read-only tools on the "Tool Bus."
  - **Tools on the Bus:**
    - `read_sheet_range(sheet_name, range_str)`: Reads specific data chunks.
    - `get_formula(cell_address)`: Retrieves a formula as a string.
    - `get_chart_definition(chart_id)`: Reads a chart's configuration.
    - *These tools prevent agents from having direct file access.*
  - **Specialized Agents:**
    1. **Structure & Role Agent:** Uses the structural map to infer the purpose of each sheet (e.g., "Data Storage," "Dashboard," "Calculation Engine") based on content density and object types.
    1. **Formula & Dependency Agent:** Catalogs all formulas, builds a dependency graph (using `networkx`) across cells and sheets, classifies formula complexity, and flags inefficient or volatile functions.
    1. **Visualization Agent:** Analyzes charts and graphs, describing their type, data sources, and configuration in natural language.
    1. **Data Quality & Pattern Agent:** Scans for data inconsistencies (e.g., mixed types in a column), identifies outliers, and detects common errors (`#REF!`, `#N/A`).
    1. **Security & Integrity Agent:** Specifically looks for potential vulnerabilities flagged in triage, such as hidden sheets, external links to suspicious domains (without visiting them), and unusual named ranges.
- **Hierarchical Summarization:** To manage large files and avoid exceeding LLM context limits, agents use a map-reduce pattern. They analyze chunks (e.g., ranges of 500 rows) and create "summary-patches," which the Orchestrator collapses into a running summary.

#### **Stage 4: Synthesis & Reporting**

- **Function:** Consumes the final, enriched data from the agentic analysis.
- **Process:**
  1. The Orchestrator Agent aggregates all findings into a comprehensive JSON object.
  1. A dedicated **Reporting Service** consumes this JSON.
  1. **Generates multiple output formats:**
     - **Interactive HTML Dashboard:** Using D3and Plotly for dependency graphs, issue heatmaps, and explorable data tables.
     - **PDF Report:** A professional, printable summary for executives and auditors.
     - **Structured JSON:** The full, detailed output for programmatic integration.
  1. Updates the job status in PostgreSQL with links to the generated reports.

     I want a monolithic single language service approach rather than microservices. preferably python
     [Show thinking]
     Of course. Here is a revised system design for **Excel Aegis** based on a monolithic, single-language (Python) architecture.
     This approach consolidates the system's logic into a single, cohesive application, simplifying deployment and development while still leveraging asynchronous task processing for performance.

### **Monolithic System Architecture: Excel Aegis**

## The system is designed as a single Python application using **FastAPI** for the web interface and **Celery** for handling heavy background analysis tasks. This maintains a non-blocking user experience while centralizing the codebase. ``` .xlsx``                   ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐                   │                 Python Monolith App                  │                   │                                                        │ ┌───────────┐     │ ┌───────────────┐      ┌─────────────────────────────┐ │ │           │     │ │               │      │                             │ │ │ End User  ├────►│ │  FastAPI Web    ├─────►│     Celery Task Queue       │ │ │           │     │ │   (Endpoints)   │      │      (RabbitMQ / Redis)     │ │ └───────────┘     │ │               │      │                             │ │                   │ └───────────────┘      └──────────────┬──────────────┘ │                   │                                       │                │                   │                          ┌────────────▼────────────┐   │                   │                          │                         │   │                   │                          │      Celery Worker      │   │                   │                          │  (Background Processor) │   │                   │                          └────────────┬────────────┘   │                   │                                       │                │                   │  ┌────────────────────────────────────▼──────────────┐ │                   │  │          Core Analysis Pipeline (Python Module)   │ │                   │  │                                                   │ │                   │  │ 1.

### **Technology Stack**

- **Application Framework:** **FastAPI** to handle HTTP requests for file uploads and result retrieval.
- **Asynchronous Task Processing:** **Celery** with **RabbitMQ** (or Redis) as the message broker to run the analysis pipeline in the background.
- **Core Analysis & AI:**
  - **`openpyxl`**, **`xlrd`**, **`pandas`** for deterministic parsing.
  - **`olevba`** for static VBA macro scanning.
  - **LangGraph** to orchestrate the AI agent crew.
- **Database & Storage:**
  - **PostgreSQL** for storing job metadata and results.
  - **S3-compatible Object Storage** for storing uploaded files and generated reports.
- **Deployment:** The entire application (FastAPI server and Celery worker) can be containerized using **Docker** and run within a **gVisor** sandbox for security.

______________________________________________________________________

### **System Components & Data Flow**

The microservices from the previous design are now refactored into modules within a single Python service.
**1. API Module (FastAPI)**

- This is the user-facing part of the application.
- It exposes endpoints like `/upload` and `/job//status`.
- **Workflow:**
  1. Receives a file upload.
  1. Assigns a unique `job_id`.
  1. Saves the raw file to object storage.
  1. Calls a Celery task to begin the analysis, passing the `job_id` and file path.
  1. Immediately returns the `job_id` to the user, so they aren't kept waiting.
     **2. Analysis Task Module (Celery)**
- This is the heart of the application, running the entire analysis pipeline as a single, lo
  2\. **Agentic Analysis:** It then initializes the **Orchestrator Agent** from the LangGraph module. The Orchestrator uses the structural map to build and execute the analysis graph, calling on the specialized agents (Formula, Structure, etc.) to perform their tasks. The agents use the "Tool Bus" (a set of internal Python functions) to safely read data from the file.
  3\. **Synthesis & Reporting:** Once the agent crew completes its analysis, the final step in the task is to generate the outputs (JSON, interactive HTML, PDF) and save them to object storage.
  4\. The task's final action is to update the job's status to "Complete" in the PostgreSQL database, along with links to the reports.

### **Key Considerations in a Monolithic Design**

- **Scalability:** While not as granular as microservices, this architecture scales effectively. You can increase the number of Celery workers to process more analyses in parallel. The entire application can be replicated behind a load balancer to handle more API traffic.
- **Security:** Security is maintained by running the entire containerized application (or at least the Celery workers) with a sandboxed runtime like **gVisor**. The core principle of never executing file content and using static analysis tools remains central.
- **Development Simplicity:** A monolith simplifies the development workflow, eliminating the need to manage inter-service communication, separate deployments, and distributed debugging. This is a significant advantage for smaller teams or faster initial development.
  What do you think about the following is it a superior design?
  ``` .xlsx`` I don't expect the tool to include visualizations in its output report. We may provide initial context about the file to the analyzer, which could be either truthful or false. Truthful context would help the analyzer by serving as a hint, allowing it to save time by simply verifying claims. False context might waste time, though it could still provide useful negative information for the analysis process. This context could be, for example, an output report from the same analyzer based on a previous version of the file. The agent should dynamically adjust its plan as it discovers more information. Validation is VERY important---it should verify all assumptions rather than making unconfirmed claims. This requires performing various operations like aggregations, averaging, checking for nulls, and more to build a comprehensive report. This is why I proposed giving the agent a sandboxed environment such as a Jupyter notebook with openpyxl for initial analysis. It can later use pandas if needed to extract specific data and perform operations. After each operation, it would capture the output and proceed to the next step. The agent can choose to keep the entire output in its context or just a summary, while maintaining the full raw output in the notebook with pointers for future reference. Initially, we can include the entire notebook in the context. As it grows and approaches LLM context limits, we can implement various compression methods. The full notebook will always remain available if the agent needs additional details that were over-summarized in the compressed context. We'll experiment with different compression strategies rather than deciding on one upfront. I think we can combine sequential agentic strategies with concurrent agents that communicate with each other. Specifically, we could assign one agent per Excel sheet, with each producing a report for its sheet. An orchestrator would then consolidate these reports. During processing, agents can communicate with each other when they encounter references to other sheets. This communication would likely be confirmation-seeking queries. I haven't decided whether the queried agent should be interrupted to respond or if we should use another approach. The querying agent would provide minimal context that might help the queried agent. Each agent's report would mention references to other sheets. Excel sheets often contain repetitive formulas that follow patterns despite not being identical. I expect the agents to be intelligent enough to recognize these patterns and ask questions efficiently. To balance costs, we discussed adding more determinism by initializing each "notebook" with pre-run openpyxl code to serve as initial context. We explored several approaches, including building a graph of formulas and other structural analysis methods. Some executions will inevitably fail. In these cases, the LLM should edit the existing notebook cell instead of adding a new one. When editing, it should document previous failures through comments or print statements, as this information is valuable. For example, if the LLM encounters a division by zero error while performing an operation on a column, the edited cell should explain this issue and show how it addressed the problem---perhaps by implementing data coercion or skipping cells with zero values. Prompt engineering will be crucial to this project and requires thorough research. We should also investigate the leading LLM models to understand their respective strengths and optimal use cases. Context engineering demands equally comprehensive research. Additionally, we need to thoroughly explore both single-agent and multi-agent workflows. Our discussions have covered sequential agents, multi-agent systems, and inter-agent communication. We need detailed research to identify implementation options and best practices for these approaches.  ```.xlsx\`\`
  [Show thinking]
  Yes, in many ways, this is a superior design because it provides a much more detailed and robust blueprint for the **agent's core reasoning and execution process**.
  While the previous "Excel Aegis" model outlined the high-level application architecture (API, background tasks, etc.), this proposal masterfully details the "mind" of the agent itself. It shifts from a simple pipeline to a dynamic, self-correcting, and collaborative system.

______________________________________________________________________

### ## What Makes This Design Superior

🧠 **The "Digital Workbench" (Jupyter Notebook Sandbox)** This is a brilliant and practical evolution of the generic "sandbox" concept. Using a notebook as the agent's workspace provides a **stateful, auditable, and iterative environment**. The agent isn't just processing data; it's performing an investigation, and the notebook serves as its lab notes. Capturing the output of each step creates a perfect "chain of thought" that can be reviewed for accuracy and debugging.
🛠️ **Robust & Realistic Failure Handling** The proposal to have the LLM *edit* a failing code cell and document the error is a massive step forward. This mimics how a human developer works. It's a **self-correcting mechanism** that builds resilience and provides invaluable context on the data's quirks (e.g., "column 'X' contained zeros, which I handled by..."). This is far better than a simple pass/fail.
🤝 **Hybrid Agent Workflow (Concurrent + Sequential)** The "one agent per sheet" model is a natural and highly effective way to parallelize the workload. It maps the agent architecture directly to the problem's structure (a workbook with multiple sheets).

- **Parallel Processing:** Agents analyze their respective sheets concurrently, drastically speeding up the analysis of large workbooks.
- **Targeted Communication:** Allowing agents to query each other about cross-sheet references is essential. An agent analyzing a `SUMIF` formula that points to another sheet *must* be able to get information from the agent responsible for that sheet.
- **Centralized Synthesis:** The final Orchestrator elegantly consolidates the parallel work into a single, coherent report.
  🕵️ **Emphasis on "Skeptical Verification"** The principle that the agent must *verify* any initial context rather than trust it is critical for building a reliable tool. This prevents the system from being misled by outdated or intentionally false information, forcing it to base its conclusions on the actual data at hand.

______________________________________________________________________

### ## Key Implementation Challenges & Solutions

This design's sophistication introduces complexity. Here are the main challenges and potential solutions:
**1. Inter-Agent Communication** The question of how agents communicate without causing deadlocks or bottlenecks is crucial.

- **Proposed Solution: Asynchronous Message Board.** Instead of direct, blocking interruptions, agents could post queries to a shared, non-blocking message space (e.g., a Redis pub/sub channel or a dedicated "whiteboard" in the shared state). An agent can check for incoming messages at the beginning of its reasoning loop. The querying agent can either wait or continue with other tasks until a response is posted.
  **2. State Management & Cost** Managing multiple notebook states and the associated LLM context for each agent can become complex and expensive.
- **Solution:** The proposed context compression strategies are vital. The "pre-run deterministic analysis" is also key to minimizing cost by giving the agents a rich, pre-digested starting point, saving them from discovering basic facts with expensive LLM calls.

______________________________________________________________________

### ## How This Integrates with the "Excel Aegis" Model

This detailed agent design fits perfectly as the "engine" inside the `Excel Aegis` chassis. The overall application structure remains valid:

1. **FastAPI Endpoint:** Still handles the initial file upload.
1. **Celery Worker:** Still manages the background job.
1. **The Celery Task's Job:** Instead of just running a script, its primary responsibility becomes:
   - Performing the deterministic pre-analysis (e.g., graphing formulas).
   - Provisioning the sandboxed environment (creating a "notebook" for each sheet).
   - Initializing each notebook with the pre-run context.
   - Kicking off the **Orchestrator Agent**, which in turn activates the individual sheet agents.
     In short, this design provides the specific, powerful logic that runs inside the **"Agentic Analysis"** stage of the monolithic architecture. It's a significant and well-reasoned evolution of the concept. 👍
     give me your revised design then. be comprehensive.
     [Show thinking]
     Of course. Here is the comprehensive, revised system design for **Excel Aegis**, incorporating a monolithic Python architecture with the advanced, agentic analysis framework we've discussed.

______________________________________________________________________

## **Final Revised System Design: Excel Aegis**

### **1. Overview**

**Excel Aegis** is a monolithic Python application designed for the deep analysis of Excel files. It uses a single, robust codebase that integrates a web interface (FastAPI) with a powerful background processing system (Celery).
The core innovation lies in its analysis engine: a **collaborative, multi-agent system** that operates within a stateful, auditable **Jupyter Notebook environment**. This design prioritizes dynamic planning, verifiable claims, and self-correcting execution to produce exceptionally detailed and trustworthy insights.

### **2. Core Principles**

- **Auditable Reasoning:** All steps, code executions, and outputs are logged in a notebook, creating a transparent audit trail of the agent's "thinking."
- **Skeptical Verification:** The system never blindly trusts initial context. All assumptions, whether provided by a user or inferred from a previous run, are rigorously verified against the source data.
- **Self-Correcting Execution:** Agents are designed to handle and learn from code execution errors, editing their own code and documenting the fix, mimicking a human developer's debugging process.
- **Structured Parallelism:** The architecture maps directly to the structure of an Excel file, assigning agents to individual sheets for concurrent processing while enabling communication for cross-sheet dependencies.

### **3. High-Level Monolithic Architecture**

The system is a single application composed of a web server, a task queue, and background workers.

### **4. Technology Stack**

- **Application Framework:** **FastAPI** for its high performance and modern Python features.
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** **Celery** to manage the background analysis jobs, ensuring the API remains responsive.
- **Agentic Framework:** **LangGraph** or a custom implementation to manage the state and flow between the Orchestrator and Sheet Agents.
- **Excel Parsing:** **`openpyxl`** for modern `.xlsx` files and **`xlrd`** for legacy `.xlsx`. **`pandas`** will be used by agents for advanced data manipulation.
- **Security:** **`olevba`** for static macro scanning. The Celery worker will be run inside a **Docker container** using the **gVisor** runtime for kernel-level sandboxing.
- **Data & Communication:**
  - **PostgreSQL:** Stores job metadata (status, timestamps, report links).
  - **S3-Compatible Object Storage:** For uploaded files and final reports.
  - **Redis:** Serves as the Celery message broker and the **Asynchronous Message Board** for inter-agent communication.

______________________________________________________________________

### **5. The Analysis Pipeline: A Detailed Workflow**

#### **Stage 1: Ingestion & Task Creation**

1. A user uploads an Excel file and any optional context (e.g., a previous analysis report) to a secure FastAPI endpoint.
1. The application assigns a unique `job_id`, saves the file and context to object storage.
1. A Celery background task is dispatched with the `job_id`, initiating the analysis. The user immediately receives the `job_id` for status polling.

#### **Stage 2: Environment Provisioning**

The Celery worker begins by preparing the "Digital Workbench."

1. **Deterministic Pre-Analysis:** It runs `openpyxl` to extract a complete structural map of the workbook: sheet names, dimensions, named ranges, formula locations, chart/pivot table existence, etc. It also uses `olevba` to flag the presence of macros.
1. **Notebook Creation:** For each sheet in the workbook, a new, blank Jupyter Notebook object is created in memory.
1. **Context Seeding:** The first cell of each notebook is populated with the relevant deterministic data for that sheet, along with any context provided by the user. This gives each agent a rich starting point.

#### **Stage 3: The Agentic Analysis Loop**

This is the core reasoning phase, managed by an **Orchestrator Agent**.

1. **Activation:** The Orchestrator activates a dedicated **Sheet Agent** for each notebook, allowing them to begin their analysis in parallel.
1. **The Sheet Agent's Process:** Each agent operates in a loop within its own notebook environment:
   - **Plan:** Reads its notebook's current state and decides on the next logical step (e.g., "Summarize column C," "Investigate the formula pattern in column G," "Verify user's claim about totals").
   - **Code:** Generates a Python code snippet (using `pandas` or `openpyxl`) to execute that step.
   - **Execute:** Runs the code in a new notebook cell.
   - **Observe & Document:**
     - **On Success:** Appends the code and its full output (e.g., a `pandas` DataFrame, a calculated value) to the notebook.
     - **On Failure:** *Edits the failed code cell*, wrapping it in a `try..` block, adding comments explaining the original error and the fix, and then re-executes. This creates a robust, self-correcting audit trail.
1. **Inter-Agent Communication:** When a Sheet Agent encounters a cross-sheet reference (e.g., a formula pointing to `Sheet2!A1`), it posts a query to a dedicated channel on the **Redis Message Board** (e.g., `"job_id:query:Sheet2"`). Other agents check this board periodically and can post responses, allowing for non-blocking, asynchronous collaboration.

#### **Stage 4: Synthesis & Reporting**

1. The Orchestrator monitors the progress of all Sheet Agents.
1. Once an agent has completed its analysis of a sheet, it produces a final summary report (in Markdown or structured text) as the last cell in its notebook.
1. When all agents are finished, the **Orchestrator Agent** reads the final summary from each notebook and performs a final synthesis, creating a holistic, top-level report that connects the findings from all sheets.

#### **Stage 5: Finalization & Cleanup**

1. The final, synthesized report is saved as a structured JSON object in storage.
1. The raw notebooks for each sheet may also be saved as artifacts for deep auditing.
1. The job's status is marked as "Complete" in the PostgreSQL database with a link to the final JSON report.
1. All temporary in-memory objects are cleaned up.

______________________________________________________________________

### **6. Context and Memory Management**

The system employs a two-tier memory strategy to manage LLM context limits:

- **Active Context:** For each reasoning step, the agent loads a compressed summary of its notebook's previous cells into the LLM prompt.
- **Full Notebook:** The complete, uncompressed notebook is always available. If a summary is insufficient, the agent can perform a "lookup" into the full notebook to retrieve specific details from a previous step's raw output.
  Help me decide what would be the best/ideal development environment set up/confugration for me to work on this spreadhseet analyzer on my local machine while doing experimeting with different things, obviously I won't run any LLM from my machine, I am okay making API calls for those but for the rest I need to know. I have a Mac Book Pro with Apple M2 Max chip running macOS Sequoia 15.5 and 32 GB memory . I plan on using uv for Python dependency mangement by the way. What I am asking kinda like given that my development environment will obviously be different from a cloud production deployment with microservices, I need something like a monotlithic architecture for our system suitable for local development and rapid prototyping, before i deploy the code. our design as you know consists of multi agents with each agent having their own sandbox set up, maybe they can each have their own jupyter kernel but run from the same jupyter instance or maybe access something lower level? I don't know. I even wondered if it wold be possible to optimize things such that we open the excel file only once in read-only mode and every agent gets to simultaneously read it from a shared handler at some level? maybe they share the same file reader or memory location instead of duplicating resources? I dont know if that's even possible, and what are all the things we can do with jupyter? if we can have access to low level jupyter constucts that allow this kind of programmatic use.
  [Show thinking]
  Of course. Your ideal local development setup is a single Python project managed with **`uv`**, using **VS Code** as your IDE. The core of your application will be an orchestrating Python script that programmatically manages agent sandboxes using the **`jupyter_client`** library. You can efficiently handle the Excel file by parsing it once with **`openpyxl`** into a shared, in-memory object that all agents can access.

______________________________________________________________________

## Core Development Environment

Your M2 Max MacBook Pro is more than powerful enough for this. Here's the foundational setup:

- **IDE:** **Visual Studio Code**. It's the best choice here because its Python extension has excellent, built-in Jupyter Notebook support. You can seamlessly write and test code in notebooks and then refactor it into `.xlsx` scripts.
- **Dependency Management:** Your choice of **`uv`** is perfect. It's incredibly fast and modern. Start your project by creating a virtual environment:
  [Bash]
  \`.xlsx\`\`
  # Create the virtual environment in a directory
  uv venv
  # Activate it
  source /bin/activate
  # Install your base packages
  uv pip install jupyterlab notebook pandas openpyxl jupyter_client
  \`.xlsx\`\`
- **Project Structure:** Keep things organized from the start.
  ``` .xlsx`` /spreadsheet-analyzer |-- / |-- data/                 # Sample Excel files for testing |-- notebooks/            # Experimental/scratch notebooks |-- src/                  # Your main Python source code |   |-- __main__# The main orchestrator script |   |-- agents# Agent logic |   |-- utils# Helper functions |-- pyproject# Your project dependencies for uv  ```.xlsx\`\`

______________________________________________________________________

## Architecting the Local Monolith & Agent Sandboxes

For local development, you'll simulate the multi-agent system from a single orchestrator script. Your intuition is spot-on: using Jupyter constructs programmatically is the ideal way to achieve the sandboxing you need.

### **The Solution: `jupyter_client`**

[Instead of running a full Jupyter server, you can use the ]\[`jupyter_client`\][ library to programmatically start, manage, and communicate with individual Jupyter kernels.] Each kernel provides a completely isolated execution environment (namespace, memory) for an agent.
This gives you the power of a notebook (stateful execution, code evaluation) without the UI overhead. Your main orchestrator script in `src/__main__` will act as "mission control," directing the work of these isolated kernels.
Here's a conceptual look at how your orchestrator would manage this:
[Python]
\`.xlsx\`\`

# In src/\_\_main\_\_from jupyter_clientimport JupyterKernelManager

import time
def run_agent_in_kernel(agent_id, code_to_run):
"""Starts a kernel, runs code for an agent, and gets the result."""
km = JupyterKernelManager()
km()
kc = km()
kc()
print(f"🚀 Kernel started for Agent ")
\# Execute the agent's code
kc(code_to_run)
\# Wait for and process the response
reply = kc(timeout=5)
print(f"✅ Agent replied: ")
\# Clean up
kc()
km()
print(f"🛑 Kernel shut down for Agent ")

# --- Main Orchestrator Logic ---

## sheet_names = ["Sheet1", "Sheet2", "Sheet3"] for sheet in sheet_names: # In a real scenario, the code would be dynamically generated by the LLM initial_code = f"print('Hello from Agent for ')\\na = 1+1" run_agent_in_kernel(sheet, initial_code) \`.xlsx\`\` This setup directly addresses your design: a monolithic script that creates and manages multiple, concurrent agent sandboxes.

## Resource Optimization: "Parse-Once, Read-Many"

Your idea to open the Excel file only once is not only possible, it's the most efficient pattern. Re-reading a file from disk for each agent would be slow and unnecessary.

### **How It Works**

1. **Load Once:** Your main orchestrator script will use `openpyxl` to load the entire Excel workbook into a `Workbook` object in memory *before* any agents are created.
   [Python]
   \`.xlsx\`\`
   # In the main script, before starting kernels
   import openpyxl
   excel_file_path = "data/my_large_spreadsheet"
   # The 'read_only=True' flag is a good optimization for speed.
   shared_workbook_object = openpyxl(excel_file_path, read_only=True, data_only=True)
   \`.xlsx\`\`
1. **Share the Object:** This `shared_workbook_object` is now a read-only, in-memory representation of the entire file. You can't directly "share" it with the separate kernel processes, but you can use it as the source of truth.
1. **Inject Data on Demand:** When an agent needs to work with data from its sheet, the orchestrator reads the data *from the shared object* and sends it to the agent's kernel as part of the code it executes.
   **Example:** The agent for "Sheet1" needs to analyze columns A and B.
   [Python]
   \`.xlsx\`\`

# Orchestrator prepares data from the shared object

sheet1 = shared_workbook_object["Sheet1"]
data_rows = []
for row in sheet1(min_row=1, max_col=2, values_only=True):
data_rows(row)

# The orchestrator constructs code that includes this data

# This is much more efficient than having the kernel re-read the file

code_for_sheet1_agent = f"""
import pandas as pd

# The data is injected directly into the agent's sandbox

data =
df = pd(data, columns=['ColA', 'ColB'])
print(df())
"""

# The orchestrator then sends this code to the kernel for Sheet1

run_agent_in_kernel("Sheet1", code_for_sheet1_agent)
\`.xlsx\`\`
This approach is highly optimized:

- **One Disk Read:** The `.xlsx` file is hit only once.
- **Memory Efficient:** No duplication of the entire file in memory for each agent.
- **Consistent Data:** All agents are guaranteed to be working from the exact same version of the data.
  [][ Sources ][][]
  well keep in mind i want each of the notebook to be idempotent, meaning you Every notebook should be re-runnable (Run all cells) without any failures. at the top of the notebook there can be a cell that preloads the file maybe as regular python code: open("<file name>", as byte?), this way openpyxl I think openpyxl and pandas can be passed that file pointer, or maybe we preload it as openpyxl and I think pandas as a way to be passed openpyxl object? what do you think? im very uncertain so don't go with what I say blindly. I was also thinking in this case can we find a way to make it such that whatever object we open the file as is there a way to memory map that open object's memory such that the other notebook kernels have access to that exact memory location?
  [Show thinking]
  You're asking exactly the right questions. The best approach is to **load the file once into an `openpyxl` workbook object** and then have `pandas` read from that object. Direct memory mapping of a Python object between separate kernel processes isn't feasible due to OS-level process isolation.

______________________________________________________________________

### ## The Best Strategy: "Single-Engine" Data Loading

Your intuition is correct. For efficiency and idempotency, you should avoid having each agent's notebook re-open the file from disk. The most performant and robust pattern is to have your main orchestrator script load the file once, and then have `pandas` use that loaded object as its source.
Here's how it works:

1. **Orchestrator Loads with `openpyxl`:** Your main script reads the file from disk exactly once. `openpyxl` is perfect for this because it parses the entire `.xlsx` structure (which is a zip archive of XML files) into a convenient `Workbook` object.
1. **`pandas` Uses the `openpyxl` Object:** You can pass the in-memory `openpyxl` workbook object directly to `pandas`. Pandas is smart enough to use it as a source instead of re-parsing the file, which is much faster.
   This makes your notebooks perfectly **idempotent**. Each notebook's first cell would be designed to receive this pre-loaded object from the orchestrator, making it fully self-contained and re-runnable without side effects.
   Here's what that looks like in code for an agent working on "Sheet1":
   [Python]
   \`.xlsx\`\`

# In your main orchestrator script:

import openpyxl
import pandas as pd

# 1. LOAD ONCE: This happens outside the agent's kernel.

workbook_obj = openpyxl("data/financials", read_only=True)

# 2. PASS TO PANDAS: The agent's kernel would execute this.

# The 'workbook_obj' would be sent to the kernel by the orchestrator.

df = pd(
workbook_obj,
sheet_name='Sheet1',
engine='openpyxl' # Tell pandas to use the openpyxl object
)
print(df())
\`.xlsx\`\`
**This is the ideal approach because:**

- **It's Fast:** You pay the cost of parsing the file structure once.
- **It's Consistent:** Every agent is guaranteed to be working from the identical in-memory data.
- **It's Idempotent:** The notebook's logic doesn't depend on an external file path; it depends on an object passed to it.

______________________________________________________________________

### ## The Challenge of Sharing Memory Between Kernels

Your question about memory mapping is very insightful. However, directly sharing the memory location of a complex Python object (like a `Workbook` object) between separate processes **is not practically possible**.
Here's why:
**Process Isolation.** Each Jupyter kernel runs as a separate Python process. Modern operating systems (including macOS) are built on the principle of **process isolation**. This means each process has its own private, virtual memory space. One process cannot simply reach into another's memory and read its objects. This is a fundamental security and stability feature that prevents programs from crashing each other.
To communicate or share data between processes, you must use explicit **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** mechanisms. For Python objects, this typically involves:

1. **Serialization (Pickling):** The orchestrator converts the `workbook_obj` into a stream of bytes (`pickle`).
1. **Transmission:** The byte stream is sent to the agent's kernel.
1. **Deserialization:** The agent's kernel reconstructs the object from the bytes (`pickle`).
   The end result is a **copy** of the object in the agent's memory, not a pointer to a shared location. While this involves a copy, it's still extremely fast for in-memory data and is the standard, safest way to achieve your goal.

______________________________________________________________________

### ## Recommended Workflow for Your Local Setup

Here is the refined, practical pattern:

1. **Orchestrator as Source:** Your `__main__` script is the single source of truth. It loads the Excel file into an `openpyxl` object.
1. **Serialize and Inject:** When the orchestrator starts a kernel for a Sheet Agent, it uses `pickle` to serialize the workbook object. It then sends code to the agent's first cell that de-serializes the object into a `workbook` variable.
1. **Agent Executes:** All subsequent cells in the agent's notebook can now freely use the `workbook` variable to read data with `pandas`, making the entire notebook efficient, consistent, and re-runnable.
   I hope you did not forget that we are given each agent the ability to freely load subsets of the sheet they are working on using Pandas. we don't want to preload anything in pandas actually, we want the agent to decide what and if they want to load data with pandas. we will offer the agent multiple things (in fact we are offering the agent an entire jupyer kernel with different pre-installed libraries they can use as they please, they may never even use pandas, but I think we will use openpyxl to perform the deterministic porion of our work like formula graph etc (we have a list of stuff that will be done here abd be fed as part of initial context to the LLMs)
   [Show thinking]
   You are absolutely right. My apologies if the previous explanation implied the orchestrator would force a `pandas` DataFrame onto the agent. The goal is to empower the agent with efficient tools, not to make decisions for it.
   The agent's freedom to choose its tools is paramount. The "Parse-Once, Share-Object" pattern is the perfect way to enable this freedom without sacrificing performance.

______________________________________________________________________

### The Ideal Workflow (Revised)

Your understanding is correct. The orchestrator acts as a "librarian"---it does the expensive, one-time work of checking out the book (the Excel file) and then provides a clean, ready-to-use copy to each agent to work with as they see fit.

#### **1. The Orchestrator's Role: Prepare the "Starter Kit"**

The orchestrator's job is to set up the environment for each agent. It does **not** create any DataFrames. For each sheet, it prepares a "starter kit" containing:

- **The Deterministic Context:** A `string` or `dict` containing the pre-computed formula graphs, structural maps, etc.
- **The Workbook Object:** The powerful, read-only `openpyxl` workbook object that was loaded from disk **once**.
- **The Sheet Name:** A `string` identifying the specific sheet the agent is responsible for.
  This entire kit is then injected into the agent's sandboxed Jupyter kernel when it's created.

#### **2. The Agent's Autonomous Analysis**

The agent now has complete freedom within its sandbox. Its workflow might look like this:

1. **Initial Review:** The agent starts by analyzing the `deterministic_context` string.
1. **Targeted Lookups:** If it needs to verify a specific formula, it can query the `workbook_obj` directly without `pandas`. For example, it might generate code like: `formula = workbook_obj['Sheet1']['C5']`.
1. **Strategic `pandas` Loading:** If the agent decides it needs to calculate statistics for a specific range, **it then makes the decision to use `pandas`**. It will generate the precise code needed for its task, using the provided `workbook_obj` as the source.

______________________________________________________________________

### Conceptual Code Example

This example clarifies the separation of concerns:
[Python]
\`.xlsx\`\`

# In your main orchestrator script

import openpyxl
import pandas as pd

# --- ORCHESTRATOR'S SETUP ---

# 1. Load the file ONCE

workbook_obj = openpyxl("data/financials", read_only=True)

# 2. Perform deterministic analysis (e.g., create a formula report)

deterministic_context = "Sheet 'Forecast' contains 512 formulas, with a dependency on 'Inputs' sheet."

# 3. The orchestrator prepares the code that will be sent to the agent's kernel.

# It passes the workbook object via pickling for efficiency.

import pickle
serialized_workbook = pickle(workbook_obj)

# --- AGENT'S AUTONOMOUS CODE (as a string generated by the LLM) ---

# This is the code the orchestrator sends to the agent's kernel to execute.

# The agent decides what to do with the tools it's given.

agent_code_to_execute = f"""
import pickle
import pandas as pd

# The agent's first step is to un-pickle its starter kit

workbook_obj = pickle()
deterministic_context = ""
my_sheet_name = "Forecast"
print("Agent starting with context:", deterministic_context)

# Agent's Decision: "I need to check the 'Growth Rate' column for outliers."

# It now chooses to use pandas for this specific task.

df = pd(
workbook_obj,
sheet_name=my_sheet_name,

This refined model perfectly aligns with your vision:

- **Maximum Agent Autonomy:** The agent drives the analysis and uses `pandas` only when necessary.
- **Optimal Performance:** The expensive file I/O and parsing happens only once.
- **Clean Architecture:** A clear and logical separation between the orchestrator's setup role and the agent's analysis role.
