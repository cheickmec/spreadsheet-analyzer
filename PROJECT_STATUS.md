- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md with testing philosophy and development standards

### Development Setup

- [x] Project structure with src layout
- [x] Pre-commit hooks configuration (ruff, mypy, bandit)
- [x] uv package management setup
- [x] HTML to Markdown converter tool
- [x] Test file collection with validation script

### Dependencies

- [x] Development dependencies (pytest, mypy, ruff, etc.)

## In Progress üöß

### Core Implementation

- [ ] Basic Excel file parser with streaming support
- [ ] Deterministic analysis implementation
  - [ ] Integrity probe module
  - [ ] Security scanner
  - [ ] Structural mapper
  - [ ] Formula intelligence
  - [ ] Content intelligence

### Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Test fixtures for various Excel scenarios
- [ ] Unit test suite with 90% coverage target
- [ ] Integration tests for analysis pipeline

## Upcoming üìã

### Phase 1: Core Analysis Engine (Next 2-4 weeks)

- [ ] Implement Result type system for error handling
- [ ] Create progress tracking for long operations
- [ ] Build validation-first analysis patterns
- [ ] Develop chunk-based processing for large files

### Phase 2: AI Integration (Weeks 4-6)

- [ ] LangGraph agent orchestration setup
- [ ] Jupyter kernel integration for notebook execution
- [ ] Tool Bus implementation for governed tool access
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination for parallel analysis

### Phase 3: Production Features (Weeks 6-8)

- [ ] REST API with FastAPI
- [ ] WebSocket support for real-time analysis updates
- [ ] Redis caching for analysis results
- [ ] PostgreSQL for analysis history and metadata

## Known Issues & Blockers üö®

### Current Issues

- None currently blocking development

### Technical Debt

- Need to implement proper Result types for error handling
- Progress tracking system design pending
- Validation patterns need integration with deterministic pipeline

## Metrics & Quality üìä

### Code Quality

- **Linting**: ‚úÖ Ruff configured and passing
- **Type Coverage**: üöß Type hints being added incrementally
- **Test Coverage**: ‚ùå 0% (tests not yet implemented)
- **Documentation**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive design docs and guides

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Target**: < 5s for standard files (< 10 sheets, < 10K cells)
- **Current**: Not yet measured

## Dependencies & Risks üéØ

### Key Dependencies

1. **openpyxl**: Core Excel parsing library

   - Risk: Memory usage for large files
   - Mitigation: Use read_only mode and streaming

1. **LangGraph**: Agent orchestration (planned)

   - Risk: API changes in early versions
   - Mitigation: Abstract behind interface

### Technical Risks

1. **Large File Handling**: Memory constraints with huge Excel files
1. **Formula Complexity**: Circular references and complex dependencies
1. **Performance**: Meeting sub-30s target for complex analysis

## Team Notes üìù

### Recent Decisions

- Adopted functional programming patterns from VoiceForge platform
- Implemented anchor comments system for better code documentation
- Established 90% test coverage requirement
- Chose monolithic architecture with multi-agent intelligence

### Open Questions

1. Should we support Excel 95 format (.xls) or focus only on modern formats?
1. How to handle password-protected Excel files?
1. What level of macro analysis is needed for security scanning?

## Next Actions üé¨

1. **Implement core Excel parser** with streaming support
1. **Create test fixtures** for various Excel scenarios
1. **Build Result type system** for better error handling
1. **Design progress tracking API** for long-running operations
