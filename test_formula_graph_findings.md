# Formula Graph Querying Test Findings

## Overview

Tested the formula dependency graph querying capabilities on `advanced_excel_formulas.xlsx` to validate accuracy of graph traversal, depth calculation, and dependency tracking.

## Key Findings

### 1. Formula Analysis Results

- **Total formulas**: 7,213
- **Formulas with dependencies**: 7,200 (99.8%)
- **Max dependency depth**: 1 (current) vs 0 (captured JSON)
- **Circular references**: None detected
- **Formula complexity score**: 16,555.06

### 2. Depth Calculation Issue ⚠️

- **Problem**: All 7,213 formulas have `depth=None` in their FormulaNode objects
- **Impact**: The captured JSON shows max_dependency_depth=0, while the current calculation shows 1
- **Root cause**: The depth field is not being populated during formula analysis
- **Evidence**: Found 6 formula dependency chains that should have different depths:
  - Example: `Dates_Time!C5` (formula: `=$C$1-$B5`) depends on `Dates_Time!B5` (formula: `=TODAY()-10`)

### 3. Complex Formulas

Found 426 formulas using advanced functions:

- VLOOKUP formulas with cross-sheet references
- INDEX/MATCH combinations
- IFERROR wrapped lookups
- Example: `=VLOOKUP($B2,'State Abbreviations'!$A$1:$B$52,2,0)`

### 4. Cross-Sheet Dependencies

- **Count**: 408 formulas reference cells in other sheets
- **Common patterns**:
  - Lookup formulas referencing master data sheets
  - State abbreviation lookups
  - Income data lookups from historical sheets

### 5. Sheet Analysis

- **Most formulas**: "Cleaning data" sheet with 6,000 formulas
- **Formula types**: Mostly `=TRIM(PROPER(Axx))` patterns for data cleaning
- **Sheet count**: 21 sheets contain formulas

### 6. Query Interface Functionality

#### Working Features ✅

- `get_cell_dependencies()`: Successfully retrieves direct and range dependencies
- `find_cells_affecting_range()`: Correctly identifies cells affecting a range
- Cross-sheet dependency tracking
- Basic dependency traversal

#### Issues Found ❌

- `get_formula_statistics_with_ranges()`: Throws TypeError due to None values in range calculations
- Depth field not populated in FormulaNode objects
- Dependents tracking appears incomplete (most cells show 0 dependents)

### 7. Performance

- Pipeline execution: ~0.85 seconds for 7,213 formulas
- Query response: Instantaneous for in-memory operations

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Depth Calculation**

   - Implement proper depth calculation in the formula analysis stage
   - Ensure FormulaNode.depth is populated during graph construction

1. **Fix Range Statistics**

   - Handle None values in range boundary calculations
   - Add proper error handling for malformed ranges

1. **Enhance Dependents Tracking**

   - Ensure bidirectional relationships are properly tracked
   - Verify that dependents lists are populated

1. **Test Coverage**

   - Add unit tests for depth calculation
   - Test circular reference detection with actual circular refs
   - Validate range membership index

## Test Script

The complete test script is available at: `test_formula_graph_querying.py`

## Conclusion

The formula graph querying infrastructure is largely functional but has some critical gaps:

- Depth calculation is not implemented
- Some statistical functions have bugs
- The core querying capabilities work well for basic dependency analysis

The system successfully handles complex Excel workbooks with thousands of formulas and cross-sheet dependencies, but needs refinement in graph traversal metrics.
